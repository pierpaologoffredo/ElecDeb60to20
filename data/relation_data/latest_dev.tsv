2	0	I have -- was fought for a very strong title in the farm bill for the conservation reserve program to set aside millions of acres of land to help improve wildlife and the habitat. I think they noticed that as well
0	1	a more unified country. to make us a better country
2	0	I'm against quotas. These are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that have been deteriorating so rapidly in the past
1	1	I don't want to cost jobs. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs
0	1	we ought to be promoting the democratic impulses around the world. There are three fundamental challenges
0	1	I chose Senator Walter Mondale. I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me
1	1	I want tax cuts for the middle-class families. instead of concentrating on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy
2	0	I would argue we've already been attacked. This is a family tax cut
1	1	That is a bad policy. He didn't honor the agreement
0	1	taking if off to Iraq where the 9/11 Commission confirms there was no connection to 9/11 itself and Saddam Hussein. This president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment
2	0	I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point. there isn't going to be any $60 billion dividend
0	1	businesses did very well. in some ways, we've got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans
2	0	it's not just about women. The next step then, of course, is the question you ask of whether or not there ought to be some kind of official sanction of the relationships or if these relationships should be treated the same as a traditional marriage
2	0	"Those tapes are in the jurisdiction of the courts and I have no right to say ""yes"" or ""no."". Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts, where 87 percent of the legislators he served, which were Democrats"
2	0	It's an estimate done on an earlier form of our tax cut program and it's just plain wrong. you have mentioned the creation of nine million new jobs
2	0	to make certain that we have adequate uh -strategic forces - adequate conventional forces. They will not permit free elections
0	1	They're breaking the system. One thing to blame is these malpractice lawsuits
0	1	recently when he was asked specifically about Iraq, he said there is nothing we can do about it. When Governor Reagan has been asked about that, he makes the very disturbing comment
2	0	we ought to look to the future. I basically went to public schools all my life
2	0	It says let's give parents the choice of a public, private or public school -- public, private or religious school. We've got all kinds of giveaways
2	0	We met the goals this year, but in the previous years we have not met recruiting goals. In eight years they haven't gotten anything done on Medicare, on Social Security, a patient's bill of rights
2	0	The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border.. I believe that the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of prosperity the world's ever known
2	0	there's a law pending called the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. There isn't any such thing as something free out there
1	1	I regret it.. The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana
0	1	which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me. I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side
2	0	they are supported by the Soviet Union.. That's not smart
0	1	it's going to require a new commander in chief to rebuild the military power. I'm going to rebuild our military power
2	0	I think is a mistake. I want us to invest in your future
1	1	I think it's a disgrace that so far Mr. Ford's administration has blocked the passage of legislation that would've revealed by law every instance of the boycott. This is the first time that I've - remember in the history of our country when we've let a foreign country circumvent or change our Bill of Rights
0	1	Make trade work for America so we can make more things in America and sell them overseas, and champion small businesses. We need real reforms for real recovery
2	0	In the reinventing government program you just look at the numbers. That starts putting the squeeze on them.
0	1	To come in and to tell our farmers not to grow corn, not to grow soybeans, that's the kind of farm policy you'll get under a Dukakis administration. I think the American farmer rightfully will reject
0	1	they don't feel that uh - they know you or the people around you. many Americans uh - still seem to be uneasy about you
2	0	People out there listening know what I believe. We will leave in 2014
2	0	We'll welcome you back into the family of nations where you belong. We had the worst economy in a century
0	1	if we have allies. if we've tried every other course
2	0	we have to go on and balance this budget while we protect Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment. I did criticize the President
2	0	we're making progress. There are 357, 000 good jobs -- manufacturing jobs, which are lost
2	0	You can't do that and expect to win the war on terror. we're after Saddam Hussein -- I mean bin Laden
2	0	His words amount to genocide incitation. we're being fiscally responsible about it
2	0	That's why we're focusing on tax credits, to hire 1 million more people coming off welfare in the inner city. you have to make a decision
2	0	because of those things. You're not credible on Iraq
0	1	"That's the kind of mindset that said, ""Let's keep it at the United Nations and hope things go well."". My opponent said that America must pass a global test before we used force to protect ourselves"
0	1	American airplanes are helping today on humanitarian relief for Sarajevo. We are helping
2	0	we are at peace. I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis
2	0	That wasn't going to work. I would use pressure and diplomacy
2	0	the policies that you are promoting actually don't help small businesses. I signed the Helms-Burton legislation
2	0	my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible. My religion defines who I am
2	0	What I don't accept is demonstrating and organizing demonstrations in a foreign country when your country's at war. I  've supported legislation in the first instance in Congress
2	0	Get people who don't have any interest in politics but understand the issue and let them make the recommendation to Congress. I've got an agenda that I want to get done for the country
2	0	Small businesses across America will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and won't be able to hire. It is for the government to tell them where to live, where to go to school
2	0	I think we have enormous opportunity for trade. we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college
2	0	I'm not going to let the United States carry the burden for cleaning up the world's air. I have stated that it's my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half, possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program
2	0	I believe a free Afghanistan is in this nation's interest. I've had an extraordinary experience of watching up close and personal that transition in Russia
2	0	there are twenty-five million of them according to Mr. Benson. I think the biggest dividend of making these tough calls is the fact that we are less afraid of nuclear war
2	0	earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget. his rhetoric doesn't match his record
1	1	You've got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean. That is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the Middle East
2	0	if we modernize. I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training
2	0	You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn't afford. Our neighbors here in America are vital to us
2	0	Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling. if a young couple making $50,000 a year saves $1,000, the government will put another $1,000 in that account
0	1	The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal. All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obama's plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground
2	0	Barack Obama will change it. I also think that that unborn child has a right to be wanted
1	1	That's not the position he's taking. I think my position has been correct
0	1	so that the American people can participate in that decision. I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election
2	0	I want to make sure people hear that, the fundamental difference with us. That's what we're going to push for in a Romney administration
0	1	The president has a great responsibility. the President of the United States, the highest office in the world, the most important office in the world, has a responsibility to young people, as we talked about earlier
0	1	My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman and he told me last time he changed employers it took him nine months to figure out how to transfer his 401K plan. none of that will happen anymore
0	1	we've got to deal with Pakistan. Americans here at home are not going to be safe
0	1	I want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace. I'm running to get some things done for America
2	0	If you look at Chicago. what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he’s never apologized for
2	0	don't run her down in order to build her up. Then you said we should
2	0	We've got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers. I think that has to be a part of a candidate for president or being president
2	0	That commission did a study of the security arrangements around where the marines were sleeping and found that there was negligence, that they did not have proper gates up, proper precautions to stop those trucks from coming in. I naturally am aware of it
2	0	They see scandals almost on a daily basis. Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill
2	0	I think if we act effectively, if we stabilize the housing market. Wouldn't that be nice to take $20.7 billion that we're putting into our legal system and put it to preventive health care or women's health care or something else besides trial lawyers?
0	1	We're going to get it done. Get the economy going
1	1	Put it on the website. You said it on tape.
0	1	we have a good record with which to stand. We are firmly behind preserving our environment
2	0	your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone. many economists are predicting that we're moving into a period of very slow growth
0	1	we're going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle. I learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle
0	1	we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression. Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on
0	1	She has Social Security. I'm not going to cut her benefits or support any proposal that would
2	0	We can't keep spending money we don't have. I asked for a bipartisan commission, which I'd asked for from the beginning, to sit down and work out a solution
1	1	it's not enough. this rescue package means that we will stabilize markets, we will shore up these institutions
0	1	fighting the pharmaceutical companies on Medicare prescription drugs, importation. I have a long record of reform and fighting through on the floor of the United States Senate
0	1	We'll show leadership in that respect, and turn this deficit and trade around. That's the sort of thing that Michael Dukakis and I will do to bring about a better America for all our people
1	1	so will Bob Dole. Bob Dole is opposed to that plan
2	0	I really must say, Brit, I don't make many mistakes, but that one was a real doozy. I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century
2	0	It's like a huge tax gap. we have failed to enforce the so-called basket three part, which insures the right of people to migrate, to join their families, to be free, to speak out
0	1	strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers. I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done
0	1	They have taken this country from the No. 1 lender nation in the world to the No. 1 debtor nation in the world. This is an administration that has more than doubled the national debt, and they've done that in less than eight years
2	0	you keep on trying to, you know airbrush history here. Everyone that's not for this, everyone who wants to let that Sandinista government prevail, just like that Castro did, all of that, the contras are not Somozistas
0	1	We want to see that they do have adequate medical care.. I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates.
2	0	You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership. Governor Romney's plan may work for you
0	1	I worked out a deal with Boris Yeltsin to eliminate, get rid of entirely, the most destabilizing weapons of all, the SS-18, the intercontinental ballistic missile. We made dramatic progress
2	0	If the tax cut is your number one, two, three and four priority. We, of course, don't want to have automatic weapons
0	1	I believe that's not what the American people want. I think I'm more in touch with the mainstream of America
2	0	There's no private housing. he went on to cite three issues that their platforms totally ignore: atomic warfare, Presidential Directive 59 notwithstanding
2	0	Inflation is robbing us. I've been in Washington, D.C., three and a half years and led the Congress to reform Medicare so our seniors have got a modern health care system
1	1	We are the one that worked out the prison labor deal. Not because we coddled them, but because the Administration was pushed into doing something about it
2	0	there is no connection between the attacks of September 11th and Saddam Hussein. I propose a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all seniors
0	1	it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place. the term honest broker makes sense
2	0	Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses. I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me
0	1	making college debt-free so more young people can get their education. Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy
0	1	I think we need to have an attorney general that says if a law is broken, we'll enforce it. I think we need to fully enforce the law
0	1	the reality is, for America to lead, for America to do what it's done for 50 years before this president and vice president came into office, it is critical that we be credible. we're going to actually tell the American people the truth
0	1	I think in terms of equality of opportunity, that we judge people as individuals. I think that we have to recognize that while we've made enormous progress in the U.S. in racial relations and come a great long way, we still have a very long way to go
0	1	we could muddle through. that has cost us dearly
0	1	I'm from Texas. I take him for his word
2	0	it's awful hard to say we're going to go out and spend more money when we're trying to get the deficit down. We ought to be able to build more common ground among those who describe themselves as pro-choice and pro-life in efforts to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
2	0	that is to get a better rate of return on the Social Security monies coming into the trust. I want to get these debts down and these interest rates down
2	0	I was wrong when I said the president isn't proposing any changes for current retirees. I'm very proud of the way that came about and I think it's a very, very good beginning
0	1	in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace. we're not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom
2	0	all you're doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply. Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford
0	1	he has not told the truth about that position. it matters
2	0	the major - uh thrust has gotta be to put people back to work. we need more police on the street
0	1	we're on the right side. we can keep it on our side
0	1	We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform. We will not have open borders
0	1	it's necessary work. a free Iraq is going to make this world a more peaceful place
1	1	you don't go through the U.N. we would not be going through the U.N. in all of these things
2	0	Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country. I have friends who are in gay and lesbian partnerships who said to me, isn't it fair
2	0	I resent it. I am not going to lay down my arms in the middle of the campaign for somebody who has got no credibility on the issue
0	1	In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes. these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives
0	1	we're less safe. We were safer before President Bush came to office
0	1	We started from the day we got into office. the reason is was so important -- and this is a testament to how we've restored American credibility and strength around the world -- is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China
0	1	put you in jail in corporate America if you kept books that way but in government it's just kind of the way things are. We are spending that surplus to make the deficit look smaller to you than it really is
2	0	We passed it out of the House of Representatives. you need to have a president that is qualified
2	0	He says you can't spend the same dollar twice. I'm proud of the record of this Administration
0	1	It's a $1 million loan. I think I did a much better job
2	0	you take in so much money. In San Jose, California, they're complaining
2	0	A capital gains differential will increase jobs. We just heard the President's answer for the problems at the barracks in Lebanon, where 241 marines were killed
0	1	if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare. your premiums would go up by between 18% and 47%
2	0	I think the American people are sick and tired of either/or solutions, people being pushed in the corner, polarized to extremes. this is one of those issues that separates the president and myself
1	1	I have tremendous respect for women. I was embarrassed by it
2	0	In fact in the prior administration, with all their problems, they created 10 million jobs. Expediting drugs through the FDA makes sense, of course
1	1	Their idea was a budget that the that the American Hospital Association said could close 700 hospitals. we will rescue Medicare as we did Social Security
2	0	Not true.. It is time for a change
0	1	We need to explore our resources. in the short-term we need to get after it here in America
0	1	The only thing I knew to do was to get aid as quickly as possible with state and federal help, and to put my arms around the man and his family and cry with them. It broke my heart to go to the flood scene in Del Rio where a fellow and his family got completely uprooted
1	1	the result was unilateral disarmament. I know that Mr. Mondale, in the past, has made statements as if they were just people like ourselves, and if we were kind and good and did something nice, they would respond accordingly
2	0	I think the FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS. that's the most important single issue of our time
0	1	it was this administration, their administration, that cut out the money early on to be able to clean up water, and made it impossible to move ahead at that time on Boston Harbor. I think we know well who's going to help clean up this environment
2	0	every time you've offered an opinion, you've been wrong. In order to defend ourselves, we'd have to get international approval
2	0	the Kyoto treaty was flawed. The American people want to keep opening doors.
0	1	To the extent humanly possible, we get that out.. I'd get rid of that one from day one
2	0	We have seen movement towards reconciliation in Northern Ireland and in the Middle East. I'm going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk
2	0	when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children -- of black children in some cities -- dropping out of high school. I know what a working economy looks like
0	1	until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh - we cannot indicate what our plans will be. I cannot be more precise than that
0	1	Respect the First Amendment. I will do something to help you raise your kids without that garbage
2	0	How much did you cut them by. We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised
0	1	acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did. We were nation building
2	0	we had our keynote address at our convention was delivered by Zell Miller. That's diplomacy
2	0	the wealthy are going to create tremendous jobs. I was eager to sign on when he asked me to become his running mate
2	0	if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down. We're seeing the consequences of that everyday on the ground right now
0	1	don't believe in trickle-down governmen. On jobs -- that's the number one priority, and I believe my program for stimulating investment, encouraging small business, brand-new approach to education, strengthening the American family, and, yes, creating more exports is the way to go
0	1	he suggests that we have 27 years' supply of natural gas, 47 years' supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really. all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and that's going to be enough. I simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by Mr. Reagan, who once again, has demonstrated, I think, a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts, not only this country, but the world
2	0	Look at our Cabinet. we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties
2	0	I believe in it. I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important
0	1	Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years. for 30 years, I’ve produced results for people
0	1	We'll continue to very aggressively pursue him. I'm confident eventually we'll get him
2	0	Nobody is going to follow somebody who doesn't believe we can succeed and with somebody who says that war where we are is a mistake. I think that racial profiling is a serious problem
1	1	I'm proud of the fact that violent crime is down in the State of Texas. I'm not proud of any record
0	1	We've got five-hundred thousand more Americans unemployed today than we had three months ago. We've got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office
0	1	I don't foresee those things happening. I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax
2	0	you can invest some of your own money. Jim the have-nots are not doing well
0	1	We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit. These are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that have been deteriorating so rapidly in the past
2	0	Medicare is relevant for all of us, young and old alike. we lose on everything
2	0	I disagree. We don't feel that you're in any way hurting anybody else by reaching out with affirmative action to help those who've been disenfranchised
0	1	which is a weapons system we don't need. We're not going to spend billions on MX's on railroad cars
2	0	It's time to have a fresh start. I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans, 95 percent
2	0	in my ten-year budget proposal I've set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush has in his proposal. We think it is appropriate to return to the American people
2	0	I want them to be tougher. there's no difference on that
2	0	My opponent says he has a plan. which is a combination of the budget cuts the president has, as well as the sequestration cuts
0	1	I was surprised at the extent of it. I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way
2	0	I don't think we can be satisfied. I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word
0	1	There are seniors who pay more for their prescriptions than a lot of other people, more than their pets, sometimes. we need to do something about that
0	1	ou're going to be paying for it.. Nobody who's looked at it that's serious, actually believes it adds up
1	1	Al Gore and I believed it was important in the short-term to reach into the strategic petroleum reserve. I know it was controversial
2	0	it did not mention West Virginia. You seem to say that the answer is, well, I'll just make it that much worse by increasing the CAFE standards
0	1	I know it's a tragedy to many people both on the pro-choice and pro-life position. That is unacceptable
2	0	This is the same governor that applied for a license to dump Massachusetts sewage waste off the coast of New Jersey. all of that can happen
2	0	it's not just about women. For two years, the president didn't even engage with North Korea, did nothing at all, while it was growing more dangerous, despite the warnings of former Secretary of Defense William Perry, who negotiated getting television cameras and inspectors into that reactor
1	1	they're probably not going to be able to do very much by way of producing additional home heating oil for this winter. Even with more crude available
0	1	there is no connection between the attacks of September 11th and Saddam Hussein. We need to be straight with the American people
2	0	I think we have to work with them to achieve a peaceful solution to bring about a pluralistic country. I think he ought to be ashamed of mentioning that statement
0	1	I understand, as well as, with all due respect, the governor or anybody else, what it's like for those people sitting around that kitchen table. They're looking for help
0	1	Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won't take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario. We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients
0	1	I believe that discipline and respect for the law, all of these things, should be taught to children, not in our schools but families have to do that. I do think we need to strengthen family
0	1	I've dealt my businesses. I'm one person they ought to consider
0	1	The Washington Post just reported they have several trillion dollars of additional tax cuts and spending, no suggestion of what they're going to do about it. we will do what they've not done
0	1	It's easy to say in retrospect I would have done something differently. I didn't want to go at the time
0	1	We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area. in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy
0	1	I promise you that that will happen. As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration
0	1	I simply don't want to see the ratings on movies. I like those ratings systems
2	0	There are companies that wanted to petition the administration. we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally - a strong ally of the United States
0	1	I was quoted wrong. don't think it's winnable
0	1	I'm going to reverse that. reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go
1	1	what I won't do is change my core values because of politics or because of pressure. I fully agree that one should shift tactics, and we will, in Iraq
2	0	Yes, we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home. I think the American people would like to understand fully, it's been investigated to a degree
1	1	We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature. I am one who believes we've got to go the extra mile in clean being sure that that blood supply is pure
2	0	Osama bin Laden is dead. it had, at the signing of the bill, both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came togethe
0	1	I am a Catholic. I grew up learning how to respect those views
2	0	I'm encouraged with what I see when I talk to Mr. -- what I hear when I talk to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadz. that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future
2	0	over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq. I don't have any policy against hiring anyone
2	0	I knew Jack Kennedy. I do not support a boondoggle like the MX missile
2	0	if we're adding to our deficit for tax cuts for folks who don't need them. The economy was in free fall
1	1	No puppet. he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States
2	0	there is no connection between Saddam Hussein and the attacks of September 11th -- period. We have been struggling with Saddam about the inspectors
0	1	I strongly believe in local control of schools. I don't like it when the federal government tells us what to do
0	1	we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth. we've got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed
2	0	these are my folks. you are dead wrong
0	1	If you had a line item veto you could knock out the pork. That's the problem with our system
0	1	Russia is killing ISIS. those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy
0	1	I can't promise that I will never get another detail wrong. I can promise you that I will try not to, and hard
0	1	"he said, ""Yes, I think that's fair.. I fundamentally disagree with that"
0	1	We both want to help the old people.. I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates.
2	0	They said that they were going to fund their No Child Left Behind; $27 billion short today. what we've seen over the last four years is something I don't want to see over the next four years
2	0	They've been good justices. I have an obligation to fight to make sure there are no failing schools
0	1	To do that you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups. The key is to control the cost and maintain the quality
2	0	This is a deviation from idealism. The best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in Iraq
0	1	even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald. unfortunately, there’s been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims
2	0	I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience. the ban on partial birth abortion.
2	0	we should get involved. My priority is making sure that we get more people hired
0	1	this is a family issue. we've got to fight for it
0	1	It's the American way. The harder you work, the more you can keep
0	1	We have had less man-hours lost by strikes in these last seven years than we had in the previous seven years, by a great deal. The record in handling them has been very good during this Administration
0	1	out he goes. all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy.
0	1	Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country. $300 billion is really important
2	0	a great many of our small businesses pay taxes under the personal income taxes rather than the corporate rate. we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features
2	0	He hasn't had a tough cross-examination-type press conference in over thirty days. it's also a tremendous indication that under the Ford administration we have not addressed the energy policy adequately
0	1	We're talking about drugs made right here in the United States of America that have American brand names on them and American bottles. We're not talking about third-world drugs
0	1	You put $90 billion into -- into green jobs. the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is
2	0	I'm concerned about healthcare. not just sit back and let those countries continue in turmoil
0	1	Germany will spend a trillion dollars building infrastructure over the next 10 years. the Germans spend around 30 billion in Europe
2	0	Betty and I have worked very hard to give our children a brighter future in the United States, our beloved country. I think I did a much better job
2	0	I feel that they have not only a right but a responsibility to speak up. the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy should be allowed to expire
2	0	Let me give you a story about public education. he would have made weapons
2	0	The Strunk family in Allentown, Pennsylvania, I campaigned with them the other day. a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college
2	0	I don't think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same. Hillary Clinton went to Russia to try and convince them not to do so
2	0	I never met Putin. East Coast politicians who don't allow energy-producing states like Alaska to produce these, to tap into them
2	0	Mine has been in the executive branch.. We didn't have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops
0	1	if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it. I've identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy
2	0	It would be likely that they would uphold Roe v. Wade. I think the jury is still out on the Soviet experiment
0	1	We had a lot of support for the Patriot Act. one of the disappointments of the last four years, is that we've not been able to do what the president did in Texas
0	1	they don't require long experience in foreign policy. I believe I know what this country ought to be
2	0	No. If you take a trillion dollars out of that Social Security Trust Fund, how are the checks going to be -- how are you going to keep faith with the seniors
2	0	Clean air and clean water, cleaning up toxic waste sites, when millions of children live within one mile of them. I would never uh - go to war or become militarily involved, in the internal affairs of another country unless our own security was direc- rectly threatened
0	1	I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual. I believe in freedom of choice
0	1	John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains. When you cut capital gains, you put people to work.
2	0	We're not going to support another $4 billion tax cut for ExxonMobil. That'll happen under Bob Dole
2	0	where the opium production is 75 percent of the world's opium production. we're also sending a very clear signal that America is a Pacific power
2	0	it's because the mayors like Rudy Giuliani where one third of the drop happened in one city, New York City. I have also worked hard to give people a chance to prove that they are qualified
0	1	We've got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole. I'm going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort
2	0	as vice president I will sit on the National Security Council. With regard to Iraq, I indicated that it would be a mistake to -- I gave the president the power
0	1	you look at all the studies the different groups have done, you go out 4, 5, 6 years. we're still drifting along with a huge deficit
0	1	but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things -- [applause] -- that people need.. I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years
0	1	abroad there's new leadership and respect. Ronald Reagan is clearly the strong leader of the free world
0	1	I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow. That's the kind of economy I want us to see again
2	0	The government's bigger than it was when President Kennedy was around. I support what we're doing
2	0	we were faced with substantial unemployment. in almost every category they're lagging
2	0	I think they stand for civil rights.. The Senate was right
2	0	giving them more credence in the world arena. Governor Romney's plan doesn't do it
2	0	No, it's not. We've been blessed by having a nation that's free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation
2	0	I also believe that everybody should have a fair shot and everybody should do their fair share and everybody should play by the same rules. it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily
2	0	We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. those will be the policies of this administration
1	1	I don't think that's the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term. that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren't making seniors any healthier
0	1	that's what I've done, by $3,600.00. I want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families, and for small business
0	1	He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use. the president should have a variety of things he could do
2	0	Congress passed a paperwork reduction act. Absolutely not
0	1	The power of that concept is enormous. it will apply in Afghanistan
0	1	Medicare is relevant for all of us, young and old alike. what I think needs to happen in order to encourage the young to become involved is to shoot straight, is to set aside the partisan differences, and set an agenda that will make sense
1	1	Because you’d be in jail. we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we’ll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is—it’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country
1	1	it will come if I'm elected. I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued
0	1	in the first few years they either learn how to learn or don't learn how to learn. if they don't, they wind up in prison
2	0	I want to make sure take-home pay turns around and starts to grow. they always blame Russia
2	0	I will not put myself in that position as a leader in this country. if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second term
0	1	You have choice. If you like your high premiums, you keep them
2	0	Japanese couldn't unload the cars in this country if they had the same restrictions we had. In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite
2	0	It’s the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress. You have to be very careful of that
2	0	You can't have it both ways. This is a very, very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make
0	1	we have four consecutive years where he said when he was running for office, he would cut the deficit in half. Instead he's doubled it
0	1	the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief. I think the American taxpayer ought to get an additional tax break - a tax reduction of that magnitude
0	1	I don't think that's a bad decision. I wanted us to pay for it
2	0	to say that the borders are not as protected as they were prior to September the 11th shows he doesn't know the borders. I think it's worth it
2	0	because of our economic performance. You're going to get a tax relief in my plan
2	0	The uh - right of indigent or very poor accused persons to uh - legal counsel. the financial rescue plan that Senator McCain and I supported is an important first step
0	1	It's our job to fix the problem. I have a plan to fix this problem
2	0	It's a joy to serve with a president who does not apologize for the United States of America. in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace
2	0	Minuteman III. there's got to be some penalties to enforce the law
2	0	"You choose your doctor. I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we've been hearing about ""what about American prestige abroad"": America's prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be"
2	0	which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes. I can't tell you where it's coming from
0	1	Right under the Soviet gun, with Soviet troops there, he is in a very difficult position in taking anything independent, a position which would be independent of the Soviet Union. it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them
2	0	No. We've got a lot of progress that we've made and we've got to make more
2	0	I'm an optimist. we'll just have to see how it plays out
0	1	you're stuck with it. I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past
0	1	it's wrong. I don't think he should say that our prestige is at an all-time low
2	0	We went into Afghanistan and very quickly the administration made a decision to divert attention from that and instead began to plan for the invasion of Iraq. that's what we have to do
0	1	Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests. When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question
2	0	I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience. we will continue to move for normalization of relations in the traditional sense
0	1	they are the ones who didn't get any relief the first time around. In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully
2	0	Not only ships couldn't, but I'd say companies that are moving their oil can't, people who are trading in their oil can't. created a 10 percent tax bracket for the lower-income Americans
2	0	they started with my campaign in New Hampshire. I've supported that
1	1	We dramatically increased investment and our jobs are growing. in almost every category they're lagging
2	0	I think that is the way to kill jobs and to continue to harm our economy. That's what happened in Texas
2	0	It is something one would only - only consider if all of the other avenues had been -- had been tried to their full extent. All those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is -- is channeled and -- and they have an opportunity to succeed.
0	1	the border areas are being used as safe havens by the Taliban and Al Qaida and other extremist organizations. our relations with Pakistan are critical
0	1	First, as a legislative leader. I think that the president operates in a number of different areas
0	1	This is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world, and to America in particular, which is to see a -- a complete change in the -- the structure and the -- the environment in the Middle East. With the Arab Spring, came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation
0	1	I don't disagree with anything that the President said, except he waited four years to do these things. my view is it ought to be, it will be done on Day 1
0	1	you and your running mate keep saying that. it's a popular thing to say with a lot of people
2	0	A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that. Inflation is robbing us
2	0	the Welfare Reform Act, which Al Gore promised to lead the effort on to get people off of welfare to set time limits, to get people to enjoy the dignity of work. I think we have to revita1ize our society
0	1	That's what I've been doing for the last four years. I want to fight for them
0	1	they took over something that was down here.. It was the slowest recovery.
0	1	Now under my plan we'll balance the budget every year. I will pay down the debt every single year until it is eliminated early in the next decade
2	0	if you don't want to really do that. in the short-term we need to get after it here in America
2	0	He’s been talking about this for a long time. that is not the judgment that a president of the United States ought to make
0	1	any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering. let me sharply disagree with the President on sharing the most advanced, the most dangerous, the most important technology in America with the Soviet Union
2	0	They were going up. we can affect Iranian behavior
2	0	I saw families there who showed me there where missiles had come down near their children's bedrooms. the problem is that they didn't think these things through properly
0	1	And the leaders sit down and they will negotiate, and they will come to agreements with people that they trust. the president of the US deals on the international scene
0	1	terrorism is a global problem. They're going to do crazy things and you just don't know what's going to happen
2	0	We took the child to New York. Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died. I do believe that we didn't gain a great deal in the Mideast by bringing three of the four leaders, one refused to come, to Washington D.C.
2	0	That wasn't going to work. they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression
2	0	the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. I grew up in a family where my father was gone most of the time
2	0	There's no way you can pay for that five year, $40 billion tax cut for the rich and still buy all those weapons systems you want to buy unless you raid the Social Security Trust Fund. it's three or four times as high as it is - as it is in Japan
2	0	the Welfare Reform Act, which Al Gore promised to lead the effort on to get people off of welfare to set time limits, to get people to enjoy the dignity of work. we don't want to have military involvement there
0	1	Poverty hasn't gone up in this administration. This administration, and a George Bush administration, will be committed to eradicating poverty
2	0	if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald’s not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I’m sorry, you’ve got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma you may not be able to have insurance. I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president
2	0	We cannot pay off the $4 trillion debt, balance the budget and have the industries of the future and the high- paying jobs in this country without having the revenue. We've been there also so that connection was important
2	0	the government sanctioning the takeover of that embassy by those students. Our coalition is strong
0	1	We don't know whether he's developing weapons of mass destruction. The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or it's unraveling
2	0	We reduced our industrial waste by 11%. I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws
1	1	And we have not got to allow the partisanship that has really been entrenched in Washington, D.C., no matter who's been in charge. When the Republicans were in charge, I didn't see a lot of progress there, either
0	1	I'll do it again. we need to have leadership -- leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if -- if it's a Republican or a Democrat
2	0	Regulations have quadrupled. The president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut
0	1	the government helped with their education. We've had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation
2	0	I think he ought to be ashamed of mentioning that statement. I accept that
0	1	almost enough to buy a squadron of 716s. we were finally able to put that into effect and we saved over a quarter of a billion dollars this year
0	1	you're talking about deploying. You haven't just accepted research, Mr. President
2	0	When you total up all the federal spending he wants to do, it's the largest increase in federal spending in years. the Vice President is not
2	0	most small businesses are Subchapter S corps or limited partnerships, and they pay tax at the individual income tax level. that would make war imminent
2	0	that is not a right strategy for us to move forward. I've fought to simplify it
1	1	I didn't pick him. he agreed with me on everything
0	1	It called for uh - conservation measures so that we would save the energy that we have. In January of uh - 1975 I submitted to the Congress and to the American people the first comprehensive energy program recommended by any president
2	0	when we're weak at home - weaker than all our allies - that weakness weakens the whole free world. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective
2	0	To help local school districts build new buildings so our children are not learning in crumbling classrooms. fiscal restraint, I think is necessary
2	0	this was the first presidential decision that we as nominees were called upon to make. It's time to change
0	1	It seep into a regional war. It's in a part of the world where they're not going to see whatever would come from that war
2	0	he co-sponsored McCain-Feingold, and yet he didn't. We have to do a lot of things
2	0	I wanna see our nation - return to a posture and an image and a standard to make us proud once again. At home, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland
0	1	It's expressed itself in the desire of the people of Africa to be independent of Western Europe. in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free
2	0	you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington. Liberty can change habits
0	1	Why shouldn't we have more reflection upon the issue before abor -- the decision of abortion is made. My objective and the president's objective is to try to reduce abortions in this country
1	1	But you wouldn’t change it, because all of these people give you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change
0	1	you’re not entitled to your own facts. you’re entitled to your opinion
2	0	I believe that the only unpopular measures, actually, that could be, or would be applied, would be unpopular with the government, and with those. perhaps, some special interest groups who are tied closely to government. If I become president, I'll get America working again
0	1	stopped the the B-l. I and my predecessors - both Democrats and Republicans - have advocated resolving those troubles in those difficult areas of the world peacefully, diplomatically, and through negotiation
2	0	they do not focus on terror. it doesn't satisfy them
2	0	his policies haven't worked. the point is that we can fix our economy
2	0	We now have uh - a greatly expanded White House staff. the Vice President is not
2	0	We have so many things that we have to do better. The focus will change with Barack Obama
2	0	Not done. so does Michael Feinberg
2	0	there isn't any question about the necessity of defending Berlin. They are a good way away
2	0	all my life I've fought for a system of justice in this country. Wouldn't it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place?
2	0	I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable. this is the way the president has overextended the United States
0	1	I have voted for the major pieces of environmental legislation that have come down and been voted on in the United States Senate. I have a very strong record on the environment in the United States Senate
1	1	I fail to understand the basis of the charge that we caused the monetary crisis in Mexico. It's unbelievable that we could cause a drop in the standard of living of a friendly country like Mexico by nearly 40 to 50 percent
0	1	Let's make our schools safe. all of my proposals are focused on that problem, gun safety
1	1	They're doing a superb job. He won't count the sacrifice and the contribution of Iraqi allies
0	1	The vice-president indicates that the President signed the Voting Rights Act.. he did not support it while it was in the Congress, in the Senate, it was passed despite his opposition
2	0	Others talk about my excessive passion. Just tell us the truth
2	0	maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be. John, you are right: they use this for political advantage
2	0	The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission. Americans' workers are the best in the world
1	1	this is one where you can have an honest difference of opinion. We certainly do
0	1	whether or not there was an exit strategy. That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force
0	1	I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families. Those are my principles
2	0	That's just what the president did when he vetoed the Family Leave Act. This deal is terribly destructive to the US airline industry
2	0	that's why people are so concerned. That's because we believe in investing in education and in jobs
2	0	these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports. I'm not one to attribute every man -- activity of man to the changes in the climate.
0	1	I've had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices. let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down
2	0	They know the Democratic party won't do it. I think that you still have not gone into details about what your role in it was
2	0	It is breaking family budgets. who can work closely with the people of this country
0	1	you isolate China and turn them inward, and then we've made a tremendous mistake. I'm not going to do it
2	0	if we're strong in each of those things, American influence will grow. Your sons and daughters are doing better in school
0	1	we can come to grips with the penalty side. there's got to be some penalties to enforce the law
0	1	I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don't belong on our streets. we've got more to do when it comes to enforcement
0	1	ohn McCain and I share that, and you combine all that with being a team with the only track record of making a really, a difference in where we've been and reforming. that's a good team, it's a good ticket
2	0	I hope and trust, in the best interest of both countries, and in the best interests of all people throughout this globe. under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does - my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh - and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year '81 which will be the last year of this next term
0	1	I've had a record of bringing people from all walks of life into my administration. my administration is better off for it in Texas
2	0	you establish respect for differences. I support the death penalty
1	1	It is losing $8 billion as we stand here tonight. our balanced budget plan extends the Medicare Trust Fund ten years into the future
0	1	I might say the results are highly ambiguous. If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it
0	1	who won't blame the Congress. we need a chief executive who is prepared to lead
0	1	like President Kennedy and the Congress inaugurated in the early '60s to get industry moving again. I want to give people permanent incentives on investment tax credit
2	0	People in the Senate with him, his colleagues, didn't want to listen to him and wouldn't go towards that reform that was needed then. let me help you with the difference, Mrs. Ferraro, between Iran and the embassy in Lebanon.
2	0	I want to have more of these free trade agreements. get off to a flying start in '93 to execute these plans
1	1	make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves. We do need to make sure that they don't have arms that get into the -- the wrong hands
0	1	I don't really think it's any of my -- you know, any of my concerns what -- how you conduct your sex life. I think that's a private matter
2	0	some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations. I came from very modest means
0	1	in health care for all Americans. we're going to have to invest in the American people again
0	1	he still hasn't denied it. if you just add the numbers up
0	1	I think people are going to be looking for trust and experience. I've done that
0	1	With regard to the assault on the Catholic church, let me make it absolutely clear, no religious institution, Catholic or otherwise, including Catholic Social Services, Georgetown Hospital, Mercy Hospital, any hospital, none has to either refer contraception, none has to pay for contraception, none has to be a vehicle to get contraception in any insurance policy they provide. That is a fact
2	0	freedom took hold in that part of the world. I think it’s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is
2	0	we have a tremendous machine. We must not be divided on this issue
2	0	We've got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago. That will help strengthen the American family
2	0	we've got a lot of work to do. They're more dangerous today than they were four years ago
2	0	we want to make sure that we give our commanders what they say they need to make it successful. if you're a family of four making $50,000 in Massachusetts, you get a 50% tax cut
0	1	These are dangerous times. I just care whether it works for America and whether it's going to make us stronger
0	1	We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact, and yet when the Iraqi Government was changed, the Baghdad Pact broke down. yet last year we gave them less than five percent of all the technical assistance funds that we distributed around the world
0	1	The center is Afghanistan. Iraq is not even the center of the focus of the war on terror
2	0	I concurred in that, and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on. I think it's this pattern that troubles me, more than the draft
2	0	That's how in banking it works. when it came time to making sure that Gadhafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle
0	1	I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union one has to be realistic. we seek no superiority
1	1	When I was in the United States Congress, I worked with former President Reagan to modernize our strategic weaponry and to pursue arms control in a responsible way. One of the key points in foreign policy and national security policy is the need to re-establish the old-fashioned principle that politics ought to stop at the water's edge
0	1	they're liberal Democrats. I hope a lot of them lose
0	1	He got a notice or he didn't. They have not been forthcoming
2	0	I take classified materials very seriously and always have. I closed it
2	0	some may be better off. many economists are predicting that we're moving into a period of very slow growth
0	1	that one doesn't sound good. it's not affordable
0	1	the important thing is what are we going to do now. We need to help people who are between jobs
0	1	look at manufacturing. We have lost 1.4 million jobs in manufacturing under George Bush and Dan Quayle
2	0	I was just endorsed—and more are coming next week—it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here—admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country. people want their schools open.
2	0	I think he paid about the same percentage as I did in total taxes. I believe that my plan is better than Senator Dole's ill-advised $550 billion scheme
1	1	I think it's going in exactly the wrong direction. I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life.
2	0	we would have a fight between Sunnis and Shias. recognizing that if we're going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven's sakes, let's go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we're asking of them
2	0	That's a principle. Peace in Bosnia
2	0	the polls to me are interesting, but they don't determine, you know, my hopes or - or my despair. we also have to have nuclear power
0	1	He’s worked on it.. I’m proud of him.
0	1	which I used four years in Georgia. I'm going to institute zero-based budgeting
2	0	I'm so proud of what she accomplished in getting them on there. I would say that the concept of the Dukakis family has my great respect
0	1	we've got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work. I want to keep this economic recovery going
2	0	They will expand. We have gone from the biggest deficits to the biggest surpluses
2	0	I know that uh Chief Justice Burger is. This kind of deterioration in our economic strength is bound to weaken us around the world
1	1	I was very patient in letting you get off that string of attacks. Why doesn't the Democratic Congress -- why doesn't the Democratic Congress pass the presidentâ€™s bill?
0	1	The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh - my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take 'em off on the corporations. Mr. Ford is - is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy
2	0	We cannot pay off the $4 trillion debt, balance the budget and have the industries of the future and the high- paying jobs in this country without having the revenue. I don't want the federal government making decisions for consumers or for providers
0	1	be they men or women, be they single or married. our plans are for the future, focus very much about giving as much control as we can to individual Americans
0	1	The sooner the better. We've got some agreement on the nuclear, but we don't have those things put away yet
2	0	both in the Senate and as vice president. That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace
2	0	Warren Buffett is the one who’s gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. The amount of money being spent to try to mislead the American people is demagoguery
2	0	she’s lied about a lot of things. the economy is not doing well
2	0	he did not support it while it was in the Congress, in the Senate, it was passed despite his opposition. This man has outspent me and the special interests are outspending me
0	1	that's important. That's one thing I'm an insider on
0	1	He went down and made a speech to people who were on his side saying that I did the wrong thing. Senator Dole opposed me
2	0	whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know. I've opposed that
2	0	We've had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen. I'm concerned that that will get overturned
0	1	I carry a little card in my pocket called the Tenth Amendment. I guess I rely more on the individual
2	0	A President is called the Commander in Chief. if the measures the military has taken do not take hold, we will not go on joint patrols
0	1	we're going to have to put some additional troops in Afghanistan. We are going to have to make the Iraqi government start taking more responsibility, withdraw our troops in a responsible way over time
0	1	The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I'm talking about in terms of education. it's a combination of these things
0	1	I know some things about the Vietnam War better than anybody in the world. I know how governments, how American governments can be -- can be courageous
2	0	in that 90- day period before the inauguration, put together the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas present. It has reduced by 25 percent the amount of monies going into college education and by a third those going into secondary and primary schools.
0	1	We had the best Black unemployment numbers in the history of our country, Hispanic, women, Asian, people with diplomas, with no diplomas, MIT graduates, number one in the class. everybody had the best numbers
2	0	the larger issue that we don't cover Americans. Yes, that’s true, I didn’t
2	0	These cards make sense. the fact of it is we're so far away from research that even comes close to that
0	1	Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them.. I think it cannot work
0	1	The Romneys didn't know them. The Nixons told this story
1	1	middle-class Americans are basically the only group of Americans who've been taxed more in the 1980s and during the last 12 years, even though their incomes have gone down. There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more
2	0	I'm pleased to see, Dick, from the newspapers that you're better off than you were eight years ago, too. policies like these have been working
2	0	"He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ""You complain, I'll get you deported. There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done"
1	1	Show me one accomplishment toward Medicare that he accomplished. He's been in the United States Senate 20 years
2	0	indeed, every time it has increased you will find there is an increase in minority unemployment among young people. Keep America at work
0	1	It's not soft. in my judgment it was a proper action
2	0	In Oregon, not too long ago, a farmer took 25 percent of his property and declared it a wetland. It had the runoff of snow that allowed it to be declared a wetland, but he did it himself voluntarily. He found within a couple of years that the Bald Eagle began to use it as a habitat. The Corporations of Engineers, the Bureau of Wildlife and Fisheries, all of the federal agencies came onto his property, declared it a federal wetland and said he couldn't drive. They took away the road, he couldn't mend his fences and they wouldn't pay the value of the loss of the -- they wouldn't pay -- or compensate, I should say, for the loss of value to that property. These are two individuals who have been for the war when the headlines were good and against it when their poll ratings were bad
2	0	the parent can go to a tutoring program or another public school or another private school. the tools now given to the terrorist fighters are the same tools that we've been using against drug dealers and white-collar criminals
2	0	when I came home from prison, I saw our veterans being very badly treated. We're not going to run away
0	1	He won't tell us. He says that he's going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don't know exactly which ones
0	1	another trillion dollars. He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans
0	1	There has been reference to expensive spare parts, hammers costing $500.. I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons.
0	1	I will see that these standards apply to the United States Congress. we need the highest possible ethical standards
2	0	You're familiar, I'm sure, with the recognition given in the Air Force to uh - General James. This will work
2	0	We're going to make it affordable and accessible. I think the matter is closed once and for all
0	1	Hawaii does it. I think Mr. Perot and I agree on this, there has to be a national commission of health care providers and health care consumers that set ceilings to keep health costs in line with inflation, plus population growth
0	1	I mean they do have elections that are coming up on November 4. I think we have to work with them to achieve a peaceful solution to bring about a pluralistic country
1	1	Yes, we should make a great effort. when Senator Kennedy suggests that we haven't been making an effort
2	0	There are extremists in all parts of the Middle East who want to kill that peace process. I am part of an administration that has the finest record on diversity
2	0	He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion. They need to be tightened
2	0	Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. I just don't think that's right
0	1	there were reports. public reports not long ago about ships that could not leave American ports because of a lack of crews. I am well aware of the present deficiencies in the Armed Forces of this country
2	0	when somebody gets sentenced, hey, this is for real. I want to give power back to the states and back to the people
2	0	It seemed to me the violence stopped when these leaders came to America.. He makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go round and defend our liberty and our freedom
2	0	In other words, we're going to take Joe's money, give it to Senator Obama, and let him spread the wealth around. I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it
2	0	I think we shouldn't do it that quickly. he has a plan for raising taxes
2	0	It is not the kind of coalition we were described when we were talking about voting for this. All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing along here, we can keep talks going on, we're just going to keep on spinning centrifuges
1	1	That needs to happen. As you hear from intelligence sources even today, the -- the insurgents are highly disparate
0	1	If everybody who paid income taxes last year, including successful small businesses, doubled their income taxes this year, we'd still have a $300 billion deficit. we think that government taking 28 percent of a family and business's income is enough
0	1	he's not a happy camper. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems
2	0	That year I happened to pay a lot of state and local taxes, which as you know are deducted from the other,. every American family ought to have the right to see a doctor of their own choosing when they need to see a doctor
2	0	"They are veterans and people fighting in Afghanistan right now who are, quote, ""not paying any tax."". we have weakened our position in NATO"
0	1	We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back. We were nation building
2	0	They were going to take away our businesses.. we're not going into a recession in this country, economically
1	1	we need tax relief for Americans so that jobs can be created here. Barack Obama and Senator Biden also voted for the largest tax increases in U.S. history
0	1	if it's in our vital national interests, and that means whether our territory is threatened or people could be harmed, whether or not the alliances are -- our defense alliances are threatened, whether or not our friends in the Middle East are threatened. That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force
2	0	Putting ideas on the table, working with Democrats. you probably detected my frustration with their attitude about the American people
2	0	I'm going to stand up and say, hey, listen, here's my side of it. The people of Texas
0	1	we've got uh - the highest unemployment we've had uh - under Mr. Ford's administration, since the Great Depression. This affects human beings, and - and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration
2	0	The bill originally covered employers of 25 and more. what I've also said is for young people who come here
2	0	We have to make sure this program is there for the long term. That to me is pretty extreme
0	1	nobody has ever criticized me for not having strong beliefs. one other thing that qualifies you for being president -- and it's this, Hal -- you've got to stand up for what you believe in
1	1	That's not what the Constitution says. That's a personal opinion
0	1	believe that we should continue to use it, to continue to go after the people that represent a threat to this nation and to our friends. I believe we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world
2	0	they are supported by the Soviet Union.. I think there's a better way to do it
2	0	we're on the track on this one. it's a personal and private, moral judgment
0	1	we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana. the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers' money
1	1	I think that would destroy the integrity and the strength of NATO. Mr. Carter has indicated he would look with sympathy to a Communist government in NATO
0	1	if we spread freedom and liberty around the world. Yes, we can be safe and secure
0	1	I'll make sure we can reform Medicare and Social Security to preserve them for coming -- coming generations. I will
2	0	I would pick somebody who would strictly interpret the Constitution of the United States. the choice for America is, you can have a plan that I've laid out in four points
0	1	we let the Europeans spend $25-$40 billion on Airbus without an appropriate competitive response. the real thing we got to have is a competitive economic strategy
2	0	we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth. In some places, yes
0	1	it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981.. an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us
0	1	We would stop the spread of nuclear weapons. My first priority would be to keep this country safe
2	0	what we have been able to do is establish a program that is working, that is putting people back to work. isn't it a paradox that we have the highest productivity in our workforce in the industrialized world and at the same time have the largest trade deficit, and at the same time rank behind 9 other nations in what we pay our most productive people in the world, and we're losing whole industries overseas
2	0	Whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well-equipped. this is a fundamental problem with Bill Clinton, is trust and character
2	0	I won't, I never repeat what I've talked to the President about. I vetoed the strip-mining bill
2	0	what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country. Civility, responsibility, racial reconciliation, healing the wounds of our country has to be one of the greatest, most singularly important goals for this country here on the edge of the 21st Century
0	1	it's going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes. the next president has to make sure that the next Treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a homeowner
0	1	My brother probably died partly because of cigarettes. Not until again in 1996 -- I don't want anybody to smoke
2	0	I want to increase spending 14 percent. we are not equal in this treaty for one reason alone
2	0	you look at what’s going on with divorce. That's a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years
2	0	I'm really strongly committed to clean water and clean air, and cleaning up the new kinds of challenges like global warming. this isn't basic research
2	0	to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion. I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it
0	1	we need technical assistance. What tools do we need to fight us
2	0	now we have half-a-trillion-dollar deficit annually. This is unconscionable
2	0	UAE is helping train police. Senator McCain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut
2	0	he takes responsibility for -- for that -- for the failure in providing those security resources. we need more police on the street
0	1	get rid of the greed and corruption on Wall Street and in Washington. I think we need a little bit of reality from Wasilla Main Street there, brought to Washington, DC
0	1	she caused the violence. she talks about violence at my rallies
2	0	to continue to expand Pell Grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma. I think Ross is right and that we do need some more restrictions on lobbyists
0	1	the issue is changing. It's time to have somebody to step up and say look, let's let younger workers take some of their own money and under certain guidelines invest it in the private markets
2	0	That's not much of a response to the immediate problem that gasoline consumers and home heating oil customers are facing this winter. in November of 1975 I was the first president to order the executive branch to take action, affirmative action, through the Department of Commerce and other cabinet departments, to make certain that no American businessman or business organization should discriminate against Jews because of an Arab boycott
0	1	of wiping Israel off the map. who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel
0	1	I talk to Tony Blair all the time. I know how these people think
0	1	Some of our troops are not well-equipped. Morale in today's military is too low
2	0	They didn't do it. we're being fiscally responsible about it
0	1	China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years. manufacturers here in the U.S. making the same products can't compete
0	1	He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live. I don't think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge at the time
0	1	Mali has been taken over, the northern part of Mali by al-Qaeda type individuals. we've seen in nation after nation, a number of disturbing events
2	0	We don't want another Iraq. That's what's wrong with Mr. Bush
2	0	I'm for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile. Liberty can change habits
2	0	which is absolutely false. I could suggest another choice that you have
1	1	What plan is that that's just going to raise taxes on those making over $200,000 a year. We want to cut taxes on middle-income families and raise them on those making more than $200,000 a year
2	0	they have guns. my opponent says he's going to try to change the dynamics on the ground
0	1	We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits and cuts to our people. we did it there
0	1	I propose an American version of what works in other countries. my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics
0	1	I believe that he will be outstanding. Dan Quayle is one of them and I am one of them
0	1	Four years ago I ran for president at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration. I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play
0	1	Russia is a country in transition. Vladimir is going to have to make some hard choices
0	1	He served this nation with great, great skill and courage and bravery for thirty-five years. I think in the fact that he apologized, that he was reprimanded, uh - does permit him to stay on and continue that kind of leadership that's we so badly need
0	1	preserve the environment. I believe that my plan is better than Senator Dole's ill-advised $550 billion scheme
2	0	We went to Lebanon to give peace a chance, to stop the bombing of civilians in Beirut, to remove 13,000 terrorists from Lebanon. the answer is to discipline both the executive branch and the congressional branch by holding the line on taxes
2	0	I've supported Medicare ever since. Come right in. Come right over.
2	0	Al Gore and I were two of the ten Democrats in the Senate who crossed party lines to support President Bush and Secretary Cheney in that war. It is the responsibility of the Afghans to take care of their own security
2	0	it is a very different thing. that's what we ought to do for all people in America
2	0	Now 60 percent go to the Arab countries. we are weak
2	0	my first job as commander in chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe. Today we're well on our way to a 600-ship navy
0	1	You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia. You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals
2	0	Bill Clinton and I will change that. What we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face
1	1	I don't say the Democrats are united in their support of the program.. I do say a majority are.
0	1	Bullying is up. there’s a lot of fear—in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect
2	0	When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability -- confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years. It's a time to draw ourselves together
0	1	Remains to be seen, however, whether or not there's going to be a political settlement in Kosovo. I certainly hope there is one
2	0	we can't expect that if we do the same things that we've been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome. Ours are permanent, ours is a good plan
2	0	In order for the sanctions to be effective, we should have been working with the British, French and Germans and other countries. The HMOs and the insurance companies support the other bill that's pending, the one that the Republican majority has put forward
2	0	every individual instance is different. She's a reformer
2	0	Senator McCain is absolutely right. Wonderful new legislation that's helping blacks more and more.
0	1	I want to rebuild the military power. The mission is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place
0	1	It is five times as large geographically. It's a different country
2	0	You can spend it on anything you want to. I'm going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry
2	0	I have. we're going to stay engaged, as long as I'm president, working to improve things
2	0	We passed an anti-crime Bill that has 60 new death penalty provisions. As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens
2	0	Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record
2	0	More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us. If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition
2	0	problems are growing abroad. We do those things
0	1	There's a lot of shut-in gas that we need to be moving out of Alaska by pipeline. the difference is we need to explore at home
0	1	the front on this war is more than just one place. to say that there's only one focus on the war on terror doesn't really understand the nature of the war on terror
1	1	There were several off-the-subject quaffers in that litany. This is a serious business
0	1	we captured it in Afghanistan. that's what Osama bin Laden's handbook said
2	0	we were nation building. we do have to have change
2	0	I've been involved these issues for many, many years. I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world
0	1	I stood there, and I met the people. I heard them ask just for something that would give them hope
0	1	if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair. you could lower taxes for everyone
0	1	Did we inflict any damage? No. Did we have any allies helping? Well, we have Great Britain
2	0	There was a recent investigation of the number in Texas who got -- who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records. Under this administration we've had a continuation of the so-called balance of power politics
2	0	just a day or two ago, the attorney general of the United States made a further investigation and came to precisely the same conclusion. for the last four years we have worked had to put more and more pressure on the Castro government to bring about more openness and move toward democracy
2	0	I went to the Olympics when they were in trouble to try and get them on track. He made a mistake in invading Iraq
0	1	I’ve worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I’ve met with a lot of them, and I’ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that’s what I want to see.
0	1	We have learned that you give him an inch he'll take a mile. Is it fully effective? Did it make him withdraw from the north? Well, he does , he has a little bit, and I hope he will continue
2	0	the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years. I haven't heard anything yet
0	1	not what's good for Main Street. we need it not just when there's a crisis
2	0	because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn’t say it. Now I'm being criticized for not working with the U.N
0	1	Another is to pass -- to get our seniors to sign up to these drug discount cards. they're working
2	0	I'll get Osama bin Laden. One out of almost two children in Cleveland are now living in poverty
0	1	there are a lot of parents who feel like everything is going well in their child's school. all of a sudden they wake up and realize that wait a minute, standards aren't being met
0	1	Asia will be our largest trading partner in the future. It will be a growing and a closer relationship
0	1	The role of government: Look behind us. The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence
2	0	he’s never come up with a plan. if you were to adopt the president's plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security
0	1	We don't have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles. We uh - now encourage people to waste electricity, and uh - by giving uh - the lowest rates to the biggest users
0	1	The control of these weapons is the single major responsibility of a President. to cast out this commitment of all Presidents, because of some slight technicalities that can be corrected, is a very dangerous approach
2	0	I believe in self-reliance and individual initiative and risk takers being rewarded. This is the biggest kiss that's been given to -- to New York banks I've ever seen
2	0	But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week. I've done that
2	0	Our tax rate for business in America is 35 percent. I have kept in touch with the indigenous Iraqi opposition, broad based, to Saddam Hussein
2	0	We're gonna run out of oil. because I think whoever is the president must guard your liberties, must not erode your rights in America.
2	0	You know what I had to do in the state of Alaska?. He talks about a smaller government
2	0	not just in Libya. we use diplomacy every chance we get, believe me
0	1	We're going to find that the fact that we don't have an energy policy out there is one of the major storm clouds on the horizon for our economy. we do have to get on with developing those resources
0	1	my plan in the next 12 years would save $2.2 trillion in public and private money to reinvest in this economy. the average family would save $1200 a year under the plan that I offered without any erosion in the quality of health care
0	1	In uh - December of uh - 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress. Mr. Ford is - is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy
0	1	You can buy back in if you want with this voucher, which will not keep pace -- will not keep pace with health care costs. That's why they go the voucher
2	0	And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are saying they're dropping insurance because they can't afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. it's my proposal
0	1	A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can't do it because it's school property. These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation
0	1	I'm going to put in place a better homeland security effort. 95 percent of our containers coming into this country are not inspected today
0	1	I think we just look at the facts. We ask the people that are viewing tonight, are you better off than you were four years ago.
2	0	We need to talk about what we will do that they haven't done. Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts, where 87 percent of the legislators he served, which were Democrats
2	0	Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. I'm fully prepared to accept any mistakes that history judges to my administration
2	0	That's why most experts say that this tax scheme will blow a huge hole in the deficit, raise interest rates and weaken the economy. they need more tax relief
2	0	When they see hatred going on, they have to report it. I want our legal system to work better
1	1	I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan. We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised
0	1	The key is to get the Iraqis to take on the responsibility for their own security. That's exactly what we're doing
0	1	His own secretary of commerce had to be subpoenaed by the Congress to reveal the names of businesses who were subject to this boycott. He's also shown a weakness in yielding to pressure
2	0	that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back. the responsibility was in coddling Saddam Hussein when there was no reason to do it
2	0	we've got to address one of the biggest threats to our democracy. We have to stop them from leaving
2	0	It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country. Whenever you get a large rally of 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people, you're going to have some fringe peoples
0	1	I think his present position is he would not do so, and if that's true I'm grateful for it. Senator Dole has gone back and forth about whether he'd be for repealing the Brady Bill or repealing the assault weapons ban
0	1	The ideals and the values of the United States inspired the entire world. in the '60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the United States
0	1	I've seen him do it in Texas. He will make a first rate president
0	1	certainly reasonable people can agree on how to reduce abortions in America. It's one way to help reduce abortions
0	1	Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way. But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we’ll also be able to help people that can’t get—don’t have money because we are going to have people protected
0	1	we'll continue to spend money on research and development. I just told you the facts
0	1	You've been president four years. You said you'd cut the deficit in half
0	1	I went to the Philippines as Vice President. in no area do we disagree more than this administration's policies on human rights
2	0	seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions. it had, at the signing of the bill, both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came togethe
2	0	$100 billion in additional funding for our military than Governor Bush does. I said that the E-Verify portion of the Arizona law
2	0	Just tell us the truth. Medicare will be saved
0	1	is to have litigation reform. I think that the way to grow this economy is to keep taxes low
2	0	"I'm going to shut that loophole. I call that the ""Ultimate Bridge to Nowhere"
2	0	Medicare is a good example. I look back on those years as the beginning of wisdom, learning everything a man can learn about the vulnerabilities and the strengths that are ours as Americans
2	0	We tried diplomacy. We need to make sure that as individuals we're taking personal responsibility through all of this
2	0	We're the best fed; we're the best clothed, with a better distribution of this world's goods to all of our people than any people in history. The US should try to work with its allies and stop it
0	1	I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion. I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy
0	1	This is a big spender. It's three times bigger than what President Clinton proposed
2	0	Our country is not strong anymore. we call a Google for government saying we'll list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who
2	0	I think the people of this country know it. we're dedicated to the survival and security of Israel
2	0	Just add up all the numbers. You don't test every year
1	1	You voted for it. I voted against it
2	0	to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all. I think the matter is settled once and for all
0	1	the real secret there is for them to abide by the agreements they've made and find a way to trust each other. I still think it can be
2	0	What you need are, when people see problems, they offer solutions to fix those problems. We were nation building
1	1	The President's economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way. The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits
0	1	a young 16 year old girl coming up to me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, Governor, I need help. We're providing that young woman with help
2	0	in a showdown vote in the United Nations or in - in any other international council we're lucky to get 20 percent of the other nations to vote with us. I've reached out to people all my life
0	1	they have already bought about four million metric tons this year and are bound to buy another two million metric tons to take the grain and corn and wheat. these grain sales to the Soviet Union have helped us tremendously in meeting the costs of the additional oil
2	0	Many car companies came in from Germany, from Japan, went to Michigan, went to Ohio and they didn’t come in with you.. of course we had a Democratic Congress and they didn't want to do that
0	1	tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, you're going to get to go to school. it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships
0	1	How do you do that?. We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty
0	1	I believe if we do a better job in education, we'll -- we'll give people the -- the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that. I totally agree
2	0	That's the task of the 21st century. it's got to take new leadership in Washington
1	1	He apparently wants to spend billions on the MX on railroad cars. a weapons system we don't need and can't afford
2	0	We'll also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us. It's much more complex
0	1	we need a tax cut. we need the $500 child credit
2	0	raising taxes will make matters much, much worse. if we're fiscally responsible and put America back to work, we're going to fix Social Security
0	1	just a moment ago, for example, uh - he uh - was indicating that uh - uh - in the 1950s, for example, uh - unemployment was very low. I think uh - the uh - increase and the uh - prospects as far as I'm concerned and the I - less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh - is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes
0	1	I want a Supreme Court that understands because you’re wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn’t mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else. So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.
2	0	Newt Gingrich did. We've moved some of the power away from Washington, D.C., and put it back with the people
0	1	he'll do an outstanding job. I believe it does meet the test
0	1	I started off with -- my dad was a small-business man. I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy
0	1	I speak with some confidence of our plan. I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983
1	1	we can't simply drill our way out of the problem. Senator McCain talks a lot about drilling
0	1	if we're going to solve two wars, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. What I think is most important is that we recognize that to solve the key problems that we're facing
2	0	It is also used to give your mothers and fathers the Social Security checks that they live on. The Nixons told this story
2	0	My own background is different from his. I think the American farmer rightfully will reject
2	0	No one can be opposed to alternate energy. we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s
0	1	we have some differences, but overall we have so many things we agree on. that's one of the reasons I'm delighted and proud to be on the ticket with him
0	1	we ought to look to the future. This election is about the future of our country
2	0	I’ve heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, job-wise, safety-wise, in every way possible. you realize this is a temporary thing and there's going to be another sucking sound that runs our deficit through the roof
0	1	we created 23 million new jobs at the same time. we paid down the debt of our nation for two years in a row
2	0	He said that he didn't even demonstrate -- he told the people in Arkansas in 1978. it may not work
0	1	I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me. I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me
2	0	We're working right now in trying to be of help in southern Africa with regard to the independence of Namibia and the removal of the Cuban surrogates, the thousands of them, from Angola. not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map
0	1	Federal government has gone down, Texas's government has gone up. During the last five years, Texas's government has gone up in size
2	0	Patriotic is saying, government, you know, you're not always the solution. Some schools aren't even safe
1	1	It's not. The governor has described Medicare as a government HMO.
2	0	Even in cases of rape and incest, their platform requires that a woman be penalized, that she not be allowed to make a choice, if she believes, in consultation with her family, her doctor, and others, whoever she chooses, that she wants to have an abortion after rape, or incest. That is the number-one threat we face in the world
2	0	200,000 by the end of next year. I would be gathering up and making sure we had the comp–countries of the world coming up with 20 billion dollars
2	0	The Iranians have a lousy government. I accept what the president has said
1	1	I was raised in the suburbs.. I know suburbs so much better than you.
0	1	If somebody sees a silver lining, he finds a big black cloud out there.. contrary to Mr. Mondale's - I gotta be careful - but contrary of how he goes around just saying everything bad.
2	0	they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria. I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there
0	1	she was involved. it's true
0	1	You can't have voluntary testing. there is no new accountability measures in Vice President Gore's plan
1	1	The best way to keep jobs here in America is, one, have an energy plan. You know he calls it an outsourcing to keep -- stop outsourcing
1	1	I don't agree with them. these are all positions of the ACLU
2	0	It's a tax that taxes people twice. They didn't do the planning
2	0	It’s how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. I'm going to spend what it takes to win the war
2	0	I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out. One of the things that happens when you're a governor, at least oftentimes you have to make tough decisions
0	1	His trade deals are the same way.. He’s done very little.
2	0	Will we have equal opportunity?. I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record
2	0	We want to be sure it's fair and equitable. I think that it basically has fallen
2	0	I led the fight. No
0	1	We want to get people out of poverty, in the middle class, onto a life of self-sufficiently. That's what we're going to push for in a Romney administration
0	1	there's a whole bunch of other things that I can't click off in this short period of time. That will help strengthen the American family
0	1	through the Urban Development Action Grant Program. we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities
2	0	When the Asian financial crisis raised the risk of world-wide recession that could affect our economy. We have restored much of our economy
0	1	as for why it happened, I'm no expert on the Texas procedures, but what my friends there tell me is that the governor opposed a measure put forward by Democrats in the legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered. the money was taken away from the CHIP program
0	1	The President told you in '92 he would cut it 67 billion. He cut 112 billion dollars
2	0	Different presidents approach it in different ways. We all have tempers
2	0	I'll tolerate people. You didn't even have tax cuts in your budget, Mr. President, the first two years you were president
2	0	A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy. this country is not coming apart at the seams, for heaven's sakes
0	1	It shouldn't happen in America. it's time we take a look at the pay scales
0	1	It's hundreds of millions of ads. she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue
2	0	then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things. you can't be for school choice
2	0	They didn't do it. ridiculing a person's name is a little beneath this process
0	1	Their younger son, Roderick, is a sophomore in the same high school that Don McNeil teaches at. Roderick is concerned that he may not be able to get the tuition he needs to go to college when the time comes. Our plan gives a $1500 tax credit to make that junior college essentially free
0	1	more than just $120 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan. I'm going to spend what it takes to win the war
0	1	the President signed well after midnight one morning in the dark of night. I'm opposed to same-sex marriages
2	0	We've got to attack at all points. all of my proposals are focused on that problem, gun safety
0	1	Do you realize that today we are producing Hondas and exporting Hondas to Japan. by coming over here, and making investments in this country, we are seeing jobs
2	0	when it comes to public ethics, he has a responsibility. That proposal was turned down by the administration - a proposal presented by its own administrator
0	1	There may be some other statute that was already on the books, but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that a tough new law was needed. it's important
2	0	They didn't address the sort of the question of whether or not there should or should not be abortion in the society so much as evaluate that particular drug. Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments. their Social Security tax payments by 50%
2	0	I have repudiated every time someone's been out of line, whether they've been part of my campaign or not. I think that will, uh - in this situation, settle the matter
2	0	A deep commitment to making welfare reform work with incentives to the private sector to move people from welfare to work. It's just a giveaway
2	0	it needed to be done the right way. I want a smaller and smarter government
2	0	he thinks he’s running against somebody else. that's one of the reasons that we've seen the cost of the farm program, which was only about two and a half billion dollars when they took office, now go to about $25 billion
0	1	We are the sole remaining superpower. I simply do not think we should go back to the isolation days and starting blaming foreigners
0	1	We know better how to do it in California or Texas or wherever it is. The programs that we've been trying where you control everything and mandate it from Washington don't work
0	1	We took the child to New York. Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died. I don't think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge at the time
1	1	I want to invest in research. this isn't basic research
1	1	I didn't hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do. we're going to have to make it on the convention forces
2	0	is insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own nation, as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union. I've named four supreme court justices in the State of Texas and would ask the people to check out their qualifications, their deliberations
0	1	Our water is cleaner now. let me start with Texas
0	1	It didn't look good the first two years when we had a Democratic president and Â Democratic Congress. Republicans have cut 53 billion dollars in spending
2	0	We comprise about 30 percent of the world's economic trade power influence. 50 million American taxpayers out there get no advantages at all out of the Gore tax proposal
2	0	New York is being taxed for money that will then go to Detroit. I want to work for universal free school
0	1	the greatest failure we've had with regards to -- to gun violence in some respects is what -- what is known as Fast and Furious. I think the American people would like to understand fully, it's been investigated to a degree
0	1	they're blowing people up. it's getting worse by the day
1	1	We have got to assure them that we will never allow a second Holocaust. despite, again, warnings from Iran and any other country that would seek to destroy Israel, that that is what they would like to see
0	1	In the last four months alone, five hundred thousand Americans have gone on the unemployment roll. we have the highest unemployment rate now than we had at any time between the Great Depression caused by Herbert Hoover and the time President Ford took office
0	1	we've got to have more help from our friends abroad. America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect
0	1	10% of all the emissions -- 10% of the all the hydrocarbon emissions oxides going into the air caused by 10% -- 100% of the all the emissions are caused by 10% of the automobiles. we have to have the type of economic prosperity that will allow us to generate the revenues to provide this technology
1	1	I am not going to shortchange our troops in harm's way. I'm concerned about the deficit
0	1	He said he would work through a real alliance. I believe the president broke faith with the American people in the way that he took this nation to war
0	1	In 1991, he voted against Desert Storm. It's a consistent pattern over time of always being on the wrong side of defense issues
2	0	I think abortion's wrong. People know what to do.
2	0	we are not for more tax cuts for multimillionaires. we risk the peace
1	1	"He complains about the fact our troops don't have adequate equipment, yet he voted against the $87 billion supplemental I sent to the Congress. then issued one of the most amazing quotes in political history: ""I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it."""
0	1	only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers. they wouldn't even pay the full tuition to private school
2	0	"Your hometown newspaper has taken to calling you ""Senator Gone."". I will not raise taxes"
1	1	We are 2nd in tax burden, the 2nd lowest tax burden in the country. in almost every category they're lagging
2	0	If you create Saddam Hussein, over a 10-year period, using billions of dollars of US taxpayer money, step up to the plate and say it was a mistake. he went on to cite three issues that their platforms totally ignore: atomic warfare, Presidential Directive 59 notwithstanding
2	0	If you vote one way you will have an expansion of family leave. oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap
0	1	we'll have more manufacturing and sales around the world. I say keep working on expanding the markets
0	1	You have to have regulation. We're not going to get rid of all regulation
2	0	by itself, that to me can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest. I think that will, uh - in this situation, settle the matter
2	0	She doesn't have the stamina. after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages
2	0	the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state. That is my passion
2	0	I'm against price controls. I am in favor of unbalancing the budget.
1	1	no president of the United States, in my opinion, should signal in advance to a prospective enemy, what his uhh - decision might be or what option he might exercise. this was a standard answer that I made in response to the Yugoslavian question
2	0	the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had. your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should.
2	0	you've got to reform the White House. I don't believe in liberal activist judges
0	1	I think these questions are inherently personal and moral. won't work
2	0	You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table. We did the right thing
1	1	Part of American leadership is making sure that we're doing nation building here at home. number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we can't continue to do nation building in these regions
0	1	she has been a disaster as a senator. She said a lot of things that were false
0	1	I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also. education is my number one priority
2	0	we began a new dialogue with North Korea, one that included not only the United States, but now China. we have got to increase the standards
2	0	They're running millions of dollars of ads against me. So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that every American feels like he or she has a place in our country
1	1	it's time that we had a president like Bill Clinton who can concentrate and will concentrate and work on the problems of real people in this country. it's really amazing what George Bush can do when he concentrates
0	1	Your question is difficult to answer. I think some of my ideas might require quiet diplomacy where you don't say in advance, or say to anyone, what it is you're thinking of doing
0	1	Emphasize and subsidize modernizing plant and equipment here, not moving plants overseas. change the tax code
2	0	the next day his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, came out and said that's not a pledge. I would push very strong to see that we reform the entire situation
0	1	I believe both a free Afghanistan and a free Iraq will serve as a powerful example for millions who plead in silence for liberty in the broader Middle East. we'll continue to spread freedom
0	1	it's cut Pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country. I must have been living through a different eight years then the ones the vice president's been living through
2	0	so there's less rotation. George Bush's urban policy has been a tale of 2 cities: the best of times for the very wealthy; the worst of times for everyone else
2	0	We have more at stake in space satellites than they do. I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need
0	1	he failed to achieve that. if we had the status-of-forces agreement that the vice president said he would bet his vice presidency on in Iraq, we probably would have been able to prevent that
0	1	I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can
0	1	They know that if you go, for example, to factcheck.com you can get the specific details with respect to Halliburton. They know the charges are false
0	1	tripled the number of loans to women business people, no one unqualified, everybody had to meet the standards. I have also worked hard to give people a chance to prove that they are qualified
0	1	Again and again and again, the mother disappears in 3 days, and the child becomes a ward of the State because he's permanently and genetically damaged. if anybody can even think about legalizing drugs, they've lost me
2	0	Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle, and before he did it, he said, watch my choice for vice president, it will tell all. My plan says that we want to raise marginal incomes on family incomes above $200,000 from 31 to 36 percent
1	1	He said all poor seniors. in the meantime, we'll have a plan to help poor seniors and in the meantime it could be one year or two years
2	0	They would not have materialized for about nine to eighteen months. he left the senate, we abandoned that
2	0	we may not be there yet but we're not going to get there by giving preferences and quotas. yes, I think it should be expanded
0	1	In the cabinet I have one of the outstanding, I think, administrators as the secretary of transportation, Bill Coleman. I'm proud of the record
2	0	I think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May. I'm for getting rid of the death tax, completely getting rid of the death tax
1	1	I don't support defining marriage as anything but between one man and one woman, and I think through nuances we can go round and round about what that actually means. if there's any kind of suggestion at all from my answer that I would be anything but tolerant of adults in America choosing their partners, choosing relationships that they deem best for themselves, you know, I am tolerant
0	1	provide the kind of support for families. we would also strengthen this military
2	0	when he said at the convention, ideology doesn't matter, just competence, he was moving away from his own record, from what his passion has been over the years. I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes
2	0	You cannot lead an alliance if you say, you know, you're going alone. What happens in those forests, because of lousy federal policy, is they grow to be -- they are not -- they're not harvested
2	0	there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance.. We could uh - also uh - help our youths with some of the proposals that uh - would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time
0	1	when you talk about Social Security, the people that are going to protect it are the Democrats that brought forth that program. I think it's very important that we not see these kinds of end runs by this administration
0	1	He said, if it's good enough for the congressmen and senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice. the president used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan
0	1	I made a proposal three months ago on this. I strongly support new investments in clean coal technology
0	1	They left the planning of the State Department in the State Department desks. They didn't do the planning
2	0	we want to preserve peace through strength. they'll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions
2	0	I know what it is to have a dream and have a job and work hard to employ others and really to participate in the American dream. I do not believe we're going into a recession
2	0	A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns. Mr. Mondale, on the other hand, has one idea. Go out and tax the American people
0	1	the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes. That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget
0	1	four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about. it wasn't just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn't get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees
2	0	We were celebrating our Bicentennial. we are going to, in fact, eliminate those wasteful spending that exist in the budget right now
0	1	I am one who played a very major role in passing the superfund legislation. We are the authors, the Democratic Party, of Clean Air, of Clean Water, of the superfund
0	1	It's in a suitcase. the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies
2	0	People are going to get paid. I've reached out to people all my life
0	1	I think one of the things we’re gonna have to do is we’re gonna have to bail them out, too.. I do
2	0	I can think of doctors and scientists. it helps the environment
0	1	I found out that when I really got down to putting out do's and don'ts, and lots of these included take torture for this and that, and this and that, and never take any amnesty, for reasons they all understood and went along with. one of the -- we had an acronym, BACKUS, and each one of those B-a-c-k was something for which you -- you had to make them hurt you before you did it
2	0	seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for, but there will be a variety of options. one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions we've ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know
2	0	This is facts -- that would have given investment tax credits and other incentives to reinvest in our cities, in our country. This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out
1	1	There is not.. the vice president keeps suggesting that there is
0	1	I proposed to the United States Congress a Clear Skies Initiative to reduce sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury by 70 percent. The quality of the air's cleaner since I've been the president
2	0	I have a very good record and a commitment to the poor, to those that don't have a family, that want to have a family. They need to know that the credibility of the United States is always good
2	0	Osama bin Laden isn't going to determine how we defend ourselves. it is certainly my responsibility
0	1	we have to keep our military strong. The power of example is America's greatest power in the world
0	1	the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful. That's not the right answer for America
2	0	"At that level, that is -- gives new meaning to the word ""profitability"" for U.S. foreign policy. I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California"
0	1	stopped the production line for the Minuteman missile. I and my predecessors - both Democrats and Republicans - have advocated resolving those troubles in those difficult areas of the world peacefully, diplomatically, and through negotiation
2	0	if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country. We sent it to the Clinton Administration for implementation
2	0	that’s a big statement.. I've got a lot of experience in figuring out how to solve problems, making the solutions work, and then moving on to the next one
2	0	there's a determined enemy that's trying to defeat us. Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts, where 87 percent of the legislators he served, which were Democrats
2	0	"Medicare -- the issue of Medicare used to be called ""Mediscare."". I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work"
2	0	Energy we have to deal with today. we've also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy
2	0	I believe you can protect the environment and grow the economy. I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver.
2	0	when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. that's going to take a growing, expanding job base
0	1	They're dying to get the commercial airline business. there's sure a lot of people who don't understand business
2	0	you make more making computer chips than potato chips. I am not talking of scrapping
1	1	They didn't tell you that that same year they increased spending $1.83 for every dollar we increased taxes. They told you at the tax and budget summit that if you agreed to a tax increase, we could balance the budget
2	0	the strategic beliefs that are necessary to protect this country in the world. I think it's clear that we're better off than we were four years ago
1	1	The first thing is the tax relief program that we've proposed, one of the many tax credits for the middle class includes a $500 tax credit for stay-at-home moms just as a way of saying we understand that you are performing a service for our society. If you look at our opponent's tax proposal, they discriminate between stay-at-home moms with children that they take care of themselves and those who go to work or who, in fact, have their kids taken care of outside the home
2	0	If Missouri, just given the number of people from Missouri who are in the military over there today, were a country, it would be the third largest country in the coalition, behind Great Britain and the United States. What he's quoting is not the Senate Budget Commiitte
2	0	Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with Iraq 20 years ago. I've watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency
0	1	here's some help for you to go get an education. I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century
0	1	You must have mandatory testing. Testing is the cornerstone of reform
2	0	It was the Soviet Union that was unwilling to discuss the walk in the woods. a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered
0	1	Five cents a day - that's what the food package averages per person. I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we're able to get the people back to work
0	1	He talks about numbers. I'm beginning to think not only did he invent the Internet, but he invented the calculator
2	0	it is a partisan press release by the Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee that's not worth the government -- the taxpayer-paid paper that it's printed on. We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations' interests
2	0	to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all. which is a combination of the budget cuts the president has, as well as the sequestration cuts
1	1	we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties. It was swept aside
0	1	You have to see it to believe it. nothing has been done
1	1	Donald supported the invasion of Iraq. President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out—what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster
1	1	George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama. President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out—what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster
0	1	I do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other special needs will require some additional funding. That's an example of, I think, the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that we're funding some of those programs
2	0	I come from the computer business, and everybody knows the women are more talented than the men. I think you have to look at it
0	1	We have the best health care delivery system in the world and we want to keep it that way. we're going to end up losing our best care that we have in the world
2	0	Of course, he voted for the resolution - it was virtually unanimous. whether or not the mission was clear
2	0	Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say, â‰¥Mr. President, that's wrong. We are spending that surplus to make the deficit look smaller to you than it really is
0	1	at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers. I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesn't cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year
2	0	If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel. I didn't say we had the worst education in the world
2	0	I disagree with the proposal that maybe only when oil supplies are at stake that our national security is at risk.. I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued
2	0	what we've done. I'll lead America to a brighter future
0	1	he takes responsibility for -- for that -- for the failure in providing those security resources. I think the president just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk
1	1	I never said that. someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers
0	1	we have seen mortgage rates back up again. a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry
0	1	we don't want to have military involvement there. the right course for us, is working through our partners and with our own resources, to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a -- in a form of -- if not government, a form of -- of -- of council that can take the lead in Syria
1	1	I'll bring new competition to bring the price down. if you pass the big drug companies' bill, nothing will happen
0	1	that we didn't take our eye off the ball, which are Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, the people who attacked us on September the 11th. that we gave the weapons inspectors time to find out what we now know, that in fact there were no weapons of mass destruction
2	0	you must provide a strong alternative. I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again
0	1	It's a matter of being consistent. I believe it's not just a matter of idealism
2	0	if we fail, the cause of freedom fails. I don't want to kill it off by a tax increase
0	1	Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it. that is not the judgment that a president of the United States ought to make
2	0	yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods. Yes, it'll create bubble jobs
2	0	It was a new negotiation. as a result, our universities are now more diverse
0	1	they have let trade be a handmaiden for their foreign policy objectives of the country. this country has exported too many jobs and not enough products
2	0	We've never had citizenship tests in our country before. During the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules
0	1	we had a president who cut taxes, rolled back regulation, unleashed American energy, fought for free and fair trade, and secured $4 trillion from the Congress of the United States to give direct payments to families, saved 50 million jobs through the paycheck protection program.. we’ve already added back 11.6 million jobs
0	1	Sometimes he has to act. I'm glad we did
1	1	That civility cannot return to our country unless every person feels that they have an equal shot at the American dream. we ought to speak out against these violations of civility when they do occur
2	0	their family incomes were so low. I'm not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you don't
2	0	They deserve a minimum wage of $15.. it's bad, bad experience
0	1	Hezbollah is a legitimate part of the government in the country immediately to the north of Israel. It has been an abject failure, this administration's policy
0	1	we have a new bank for Latin America alone of a billion dollars. We have moved in Latin America very effectively
0	1	I think if you raise taxes during a recession, you head to depression. Everybody got tax relief, so that they get out of the recession
0	1	They had the ability to do everything of their choosing. When Barack Obama was elected, his party controlled everything
2	0	We take program after program that we don't absolutely have to have, and we get rid of them. There's a huge trust
2	0	Not by much.. I said that the E-Verify portion of the Arizona law
0	1	I'm not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people. The top 5 percent will continue to pay 60 percent, as they do today
2	0	I'm going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps, not by cutting the program, but by getting them good jobs. he caused the recession
0	1	these aren't make-up figures. He voted 98 times to raise taxes
2	0	I think people got to see why I picked him. what have I - going to do with my life
2	0	I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system. the approach I took is one that I think is a balanced and necessary approach
0	1	I filed more information than any other candidate for a national office in the history of this country. Not only did I agree to file my tax returns, after a little bit of prodding my husband also agreed to file his with the - not only the ethics committee but the FEC.
2	0	I wake up every day thinking about how best to protect America. then in my judgment, providing he's behind action
2	0	a president must always be willing to use troops. I do believe in pluralism.
0	1	delayed the MX. taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms
0	1	in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh - interview had I do it - had it - I to do it over again. I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken
2	0	I don't think it should be used as a piggy bank for other programs. You've gone up, in Missouri, about $3,500
2	0	What's in the best interests of our people. I will promise you this with all the confidence in my heart and in the world, that I will do my best if I'm elected president, I'll work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people
2	0	it can sure be made better. I accept what the president has said
2	0	So much work has been done by the people there with the support of this administration. Governor Bush and I want to pursue the new course
1	1	there has to be a consequence. when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach, instead of saying oh, this is okay in America just to shuffle poor kids through schools
2	0	I didn't say I would bring troops out in six months. I have devoted a major portion of this campaign to going across this country and looking for opportunities to go to white groups and African-American groups and Latino groups, Asian-American groups and say the same thing
0	1	if we don't cut taxes, and give people child credits. we're going to limp into the next century
2	0	We relied on the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Middle East, which passed the Senate. it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy
2	0	Pretty much self-funding mine. the President of the United States took a debate stage in front of 70 million Americans and refused to condemn white supremacists
0	1	we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together
0	1	he did it. it was right
0	1	that people aren't afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law. I'm such a strong believer in legal reform
2	0	Does that make you feel safer in America?. In fact he is on Medicare
2	0	The fact is for the last few years in the Congress, we've faced a lot of opposition to them. we have weakened our economy
2	0	We need to eliminate a whole host of programs that don't work. what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science
2	0	It's a very, very significant piece of legislation. But she does fight hard, and she doesn’t quit, and she doesn’t give up
0	1	The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market. he would drain a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years
2	0	I have recommended to the Congress that we develop the uranium enrichment plant at Portsmouth, Ohio, which is a publicly owned - U.S. government facility and have indicated that the private program which would follow on in Alabama is one that may or may not uhh - be constructed. Of course I support the president's economic program
2	0	Those things would revolutionize American education and take us to the top economically. let me start with Texas
2	0	We established eighty-four new mental health treatment centers. It's the right decision
2	0	And then ask them whether there's a single major initiative that John McCain differs with the president on. one mistake he's made is fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles a gallon will throw many auto workers out of work
2	0	I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. I think the American people have only one - uh requirement - that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely
0	1	we had Osama bin Laden cornered at Tora Bora. the right thing to do
2	0	we have the new program which was submitted at the Bogota Conference - this new program that President Eisenhower submitted, approved by the last Congress - for five hundred million dollars. I don't believe raising taxes is the way to solve our environmental problems
0	1	What I cared about is could we work together. That's what Washington, D.C. needs
1	1	Wrong. Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq
2	0	Our people will be glad to furnish the press, if they're interested, in Senator Gore's voting record on the Caribbean Basin Initiative.. I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe
2	0	They don't like it when I say that he says he's a card carrying member. And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down
2	0	I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president. t’s also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations
0	1	the problems of trade deficits. what we are talking about are problems that are facing the entire nation
2	0	because of its people. Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh - debates
0	1	This is the kind of thing that would have been discussed and thoroughly evaluated well before. my relationship with the prime minister of Israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way, or their fighters are on the way
0	1	I don't think most Americans could do that. I couldn't do that
0	1	He's had parts of it up there for years. President Bush has had his health care reform agenda on Capitol Hill for 8 months
2	0	My assessment is that there is no comprehensive energy policy today. my opponent said where he worked to put sanctions on Iran
2	0	provide for affordable health care for all Americans. We've had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen
2	0	it takes values that recognize the importance of the environment. I think it's the people's money
0	1	we're putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster
2	0	Walter Mondale was the right choice. And then I went down to the border towns of Storok (ph), which had experienced missiles raining dowm from Hamas
2	0	only one of them up there in Washington. If we'd listened to them, we would never have had a treaty
2	0	it's sensible. I want the federal government, consistent with local control and new accountability, to make improvement of our schools the number one priority
0	1	It's an advantage. I think age is very -- you know, wisdom comes from age, experience and intelligence
2	0	It has a population less than Chicago or Los Angeles, about the size of Dallas and Forth Worth combined. it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression
1	1	We have weakened our capacity to project power around the world. over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq
2	0	I have a plan to provide health care to all Americans. We've had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen
2	0	within a day Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, said now, that's not a promise. here is your man
1	1	The federal government didn't hire our teachers. Let the states and localities do that
2	0	We're going to have to do that. I know they're popular
2	0	There is no weapon that the Iranians have at this point. when we find a problem, we spend extra money to correct it
2	0	I think there's quite a difference between Mr. Kyprianou in Cyprus and the leader of the free world, Ronald Reagan, in terms of meeting. What I would not have had done was left 10,000 troops in Iraq that would tie us down
0	1	You are robbing the American people of their savings. I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production
0	1	I care about our kids. I care about 100 percent of the American people
0	1	It's a brutal practice. I signed the partial-birth -- the ban on partial-birth abortion
0	1	this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it. I favor it
1	1	it was the right thing to do. I've made some decisions on Israel that's unpopular
2	0	we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune. I have been fighting for very strong anti-crime legislation -- habeas corpus reform
0	1	There are several issues in which, frankly, Joe Biden and I openly and honestly disagreed on national security policy. he's been wrong on a number of the major ones
0	1	I will not give anyone special treatment. I will strictly adhere to the law
1	1	The Intermediate Nuclear Force Talks were sound talks. I wish the Soviet Union had continued them
0	1	he doubled it. This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he'd do
0	1	It is critical that they believe that when America takes action, they can trust what we're doing. We're also going to make sure that we tell the world the truth
2	0	We want to see that they do have adequate medical care.. John Kerry and I have a plan to do something about it
2	0	I've got a plan that's been out there for two years, it could have been passed already. I'm opposed to same-sex marriages
2	0	They have. John McCain is for me for president
2	0	helping people refinance their—their debt from college at a lower rate. you're going to increase the defense budget
2	0	that's how our free market works. I support it
2	0	There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago. the approach I took is one that I think is a balanced and necessary approach
2	0	Encouraging parental notification. We should be helping them build schools to compete for those hearts and minds of the people in the region
1	1	America’s intelligence community told us Russia interfered in the election of the President of the United States in 2016 and is playing in 2020. Got to be loyal to your friends
0	1	all we're doing is putting the Kabul government in a position to be able to maintain their own security. It's their responsibility, not America's
0	1	you worry about the future and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had. I know millions of you still have anxieties
2	0	We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit. that means strong oversight, making sure that investors, taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors
2	0	at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average. It's put a lot of people out of business
0	1	In the last five pres- vice presidential uh - nominees, uh - incumbents, three of them have become president. I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president
0	1	I'm going to keep my word to you. If I have anything in politics, it's my word
2	0	I am going to announce tomorrow that the Department of Commerce will disclose those companies that have uh - participated in the Arab boycott. At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win
2	0	I said that at that time. I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas
0	1	also take down the Taliban regime which allowed them to function there, in effect sponsors. The key to success in Afghanistan has been, again, to go in and go after the terrorists
2	0	It had nothing to do with the debate on Social Security. I don't think we should have that kind of a program
0	1	The American Hospital Association said it could have closed 700 hospitals. I don't think he's -- he didn't believe in it then, and the plan that he promoted last year would have certainly been devastating to Medicare
2	0	I want to get on to creating jobs. We did the right thing
2	0	I think somebody who doesn't want me to be president might have run that ad. that's what our trade ambassador our commerce secretary and all the other people in our administration are trying to do
0	1	The difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control, it doesn't stop there. education is my number one priority
0	1	11.4 million jobs in a short period of time etc. We have to make our country totally successful
0	1	9/11 changed it all. After 9/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us
2	0	$200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing. Look at all the string of broken promises
2	0	thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers. In America no one will go without healthcare
2	0	I've been a practicing Catholic my whole life. We cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon
0	1	the Congress approves it again in March. if Congress doesn't get laid on, the covert activities which I opposed in Nicaragua, those CIA covert activities in that specific country, are not supported by the Congress
1	1	in concentrating so much just on the Contras, this Administration has not paid enough attention to the rest of Central America. I believe you have to work with the leaders of those other Central American countries to try to bring about the democratization of Nicaragua - by negotiation, by pressure, by counseling, by diplomatic pressure, that we ought to be trying that first
2	0	the president is cutting the COPS program in America. I'll do it with five simple steps
0	1	I love mine. The man loves his wife and I appreciate that a lot
2	0	Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases. they'll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions
2	0	one doctor indicated that her rates have gone up so much that she's now to the point where she is screening patients. This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget
2	0	it was a Democratic tax increase. I want to put money in your pocket
2	0	I've learned to feed myself and to walk and to dress. we're more respected
1	1	The last budget he led cut Pell Grants, cut student loans. My view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education
2	0	what I think needs to happen in order to encourage the young to become involved is to shoot straight, is to set aside the partisan differences, and set an agenda that will make sense. I favor the death penalty
0	1	They have about 12,000. we've got to move forward with those negotiations, get the level of strategic weapons down
0	1	Putin has outsmarted her in Syria. He's outsmarted her every step of the way
2	0	We had the finest military in the world on the ground. In the next four years, I want to focus on the following things
0	1	you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that you're going to surrender an area that's free. they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression
2	0	if we're an arrogant nation. as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions
2	0	I will move immediately toward arms control negotiations. The federal government has been reduced in size by more than 300,000 people
2	0	We've had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen. The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place
0	1	he didn't point the finger of blame looking for scapegoats he was quick to share the credit. democrats and independents and put them to work to achieve good things for the State of Texas
0	1	He's had parts of it up there for years. You talk about increasing costs that the president has had on Capitol Hill- - medical malpractice reform legislation -- for several years
1	1	he didn’t do it. We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate
2	0	I have been in public service for 24 years. I don't want the federal government making decisions for consumers or for providers
0	1	you can’t stay on your parents coverage anymore. This means that over 20 million people will lose your coverage.
2	0	Israel could not be blamed for that. it's a special honor to share this stage with you
0	1	I welcome this opportunity to join Senator Kennedy completely on that statement. I disapprove of the issue
2	0	we're on the right side. I think you've seen tonight in this debate that Governor Reagan and I have agreed on exactly one thing
0	1	That's slower than it grew last year and last year was slower than the year before. The economy is barely limping along
0	1	A neighborhood like most of you grew up in. And in that neighborhood, it was filled with women and men, mothers and fathers who taught their children if they believed in themselves, if they were honest, if they worked hard, if they loved their country, they could accomplish anything
0	1	The biggest campaign contributors to your campaign are the trial lawyers of America. the head of the trial lawyers of Arkansas said that Bill Clinton was basically in their back pocket
0	1	we ought to pass this budget now and put ten years on it right away so no one has to worry about it.. I have proposed a budget which would put ten years on the life of the Medicare trust fund
0	1	the Congress should have uh - added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars. That tax bill does not entirely meet the criteria that I established
2	0	We have too many low-birth weight babies. we're going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means
2	0	We can offshore drill now. The president thinks it's more important to fight for that top 1 percent than to fight for fiscal responsibility and to fight for you
1	1	I'm surprised to hear him talk about records. it's not very distinguished
0	1	I said, ‘I think you need more’.. I gave them more money than they asked for
0	1	They have cracked down on the only press organ there, La Prensa, censoring the press something that should concern every American. They have not had any human rights at all
2	0	I will fully research it. He misled the American people when he said we'd go to war as a last resort
0	1	His experience has been different from mine. Senator Kennedy's is there for the people to consider.
0	1	I'll crack down on China. my five point plan is so different than what he would have done
2	0	We have the right approach for the future. I will not raise taxes
2	0	just because we don't want to get involved everywhere doesn't mean we should back off anywhere it comes up. I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it
2	0	Research is great. Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy
2	0	The president's terms are limited to 2, a total of 8 years. you've got it wrong
2	0	It's balancing a budget by the year 2002. We have to work on a collaborative basis
0	1	his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it. a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past
1	1	there are other folks out there. Warren would be a pretty good choice
2	0	if you take it in percentages. we're making progress
2	0	I think what the vice president is saying is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision. That's an essential commitment
1	1	You can run but you can't hide the reality. it's just not that simple
1	1	you have all kinds of such clubs on the Hill - and you know that. I agree with that
2	0	because of our relations with NATO. That doesn't get the job done
2	0	They know that if you go, for example, to factcheck.com you can get the specific details with respect to Halliburton. I believe we can, for all intents and purposes, eliminate our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and Venezuelan oil
0	1	it means we're able to meet our commitments abroad.. I'm not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.
2	0	the Iraqi government would not give that. The Vice President and I disagree on this.
2	0	if indeed all the jobs were going to move south because there are lower wages, there are lower wages now and they haven't done that. it is a good program
0	1	I introduced the first legislation. I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue
0	1	Elections have consequences. This is a very important issue we're talking about
0	1	We cannot send our people all over the world to solve every problem that comes up. I'm not going to do that as commander-in-chief
0	1	housing starts are down. The experience that George Bush and Dan Quayle have been talking about includes the worst economic performance since the Great Depression
2	0	We’re getting rid of carried interest provisions. We need reform of our policing in America and our criminal justice system
0	1	"watching shows, they're reading the papers. they say, ""Don't do it."""
2	0	My plan drops the rate from 15% to 10% and increases the child credit from $500 to $1,000 to make the code more fair for everybody, not just a few, not just a handful. It doesn't seem to me that it's needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard
0	1	On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with - tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there's more good than bad. from the a- analysis that I've made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh - justify my signature and my approval
2	0	for a lot of reasons. you have to vote for somebody with a plan
0	1	if they don't do it, we're gonna ask for tougher authority in the hands of the FTC on the false and deceptive advertising. That is an outrage
2	0	if we lower that rate. I have disagreed with the Bush administration
0	1	They want them to be able to drink clean water and breathe clean air. All around the world we're seeing problems that people want to solve because they love their children
1	1	why would these people stay there. this is where they think the ISIS leaders are
2	0	I told the American people and I told you I would cut taxes for middle class families. the rescue plan has got to include that massive oversight that Americans are expecting and deserving
0	1	we've got to clean out the barn. start getting this investment money on the street
2	0	we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can. he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections
2	0	talk to those bankers, did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the White House?. he's going to disavow what's in his book
2	0	Now you say maybe or it depends. We're making progress
0	1	We let families save in an IRA, withdraw tax free to pay for the cost of education and it's all paid for. My whole administration is about your future
1	1	Our opposition says lower your sights, rest on your laurels. the road of George Bush is the road to the future
2	0	If they don’t do that, it’s a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center. we can use our technological base to figure out new uses for farm products
2	0	Bill Clinton offers a new approach. Our opponents will not
2	0	He has gradually repressed most of the liberties that we would expect for nations to observe. You were totally in favor of it
0	1	to have health care for their children. this is going to give some people an opportunity
0	1	all my life I've fought for a system of justice in this country. I'm doing it
2	0	we're particularly interested in making sure that we're mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria. I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also
2	0	I don't think we can do that for a few years.. we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody
0	1	It's our generation's equivalent. This is the scale of what President Kennedy set out to do with the nuclear test ban treaty
2	0	one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops. We have to be sure to maintain that
1	1	And the leaders sit down and they will negotiate, and they will come to agreements with people that they trust. this is a fundamental problem with Bill Clinton, is trust and character
0	1	I'm appalled at the high, outrageous numbers of divorces. I believe that discipline and respect for the law, all of these things, should be taught to children, not in our schools but families have to do that
0	1	he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?You know, children listen to what is being said. think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn’t have a place in Donald Trump’s America
0	1	Firehouses don't have enough firefighters in them. we can do a better job of homeland security.
2	0	our plan is about what we need to do around a national strategy for contact tracing, for testing, for administration of the vaccine and making sure that it will be free for all. It was wrong then
0	1	I think that is a continuation of the last eight years. we can't afford another four
0	1	we have to take the same kind of steady, thoughtful leadership when it comes to Syria. That's exactly what we're doing
0	1	One of the best in advancing all kinds of benefits for children to grow up healthy and strong. He was a fantastic governor of Missouri
1	1	I don't think he's -- he didn't believe in it then, and the plan that he promoted last year would have certainly been devastating to Medicare. Bob Dole, incidentally, just bragged this year that he was one of only 12 people who voted against the creation of Medicare in the first place
0	1	We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980.. It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs
2	0	He apparently wants to spend billions on the MX on railroad cars. Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history
0	1	I was an altar boy. Religion has been a huge part of my life
0	1	it can sure be made better. I am the one who's in the middle on this
2	0	they can't do it. I don't agree with that statement
0	1	I think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman. we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage
2	0	To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other. he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years
2	0	I'm talking about giving him four or five tools - not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision. the policy of this administration has been an abject failure
0	1	At some time during these next 4 years there is going to be a crisis. it will happen
2	0	we have some differences, but overall we have so many things we agree on. I think it's time you take a stand
0	1	We cannot have it in our hearts. we certainly cannot have it in a presidential campaign
0	1	The Shah had done our bidding and carried our load in the Middle East for quite some time. I did think that it was a blot on our record that we let him down
0	1	That is a rank mischaracterization. We will not have open borders
2	0	it's wrong. What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history's on our side
1	1	That was the right thing to do. but obviously there was a great deal of anger even before that
2	0	ever since that time, I've tried to give something back to my country, to the people who are watching us tonight. our enemies are strengthened from all of this
0	1	the most significant accomplishments of this administration in which Al Gore was centrally involved were the result, most of them, of bipartisan agreements. In his years in the house and Senate, he formed similar bipartisan partnerships
2	0	I got into the Texas War on Drugs program and the big-time drug dealers got all upset. I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use
2	0	It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want. I've just defined them
2	0	If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company. I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use
0	1	The national intelligence assessment that was given to the president in July said, best-case scenario, more of the same of what we see today; worst-case scenario, civil war. I think the president, again, still hasn't shown how he's going to go about it the right way
0	1	Those 120,000 families make $8 million a year. They do not need it
2	0	I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well. it's very difficult
2	0	There was hatred, there was divisiveness. Compared to four years ago, we're clearly better off
2	0	these aren't just representatives of the United States. the magnitude of the tax cuts that you're talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow
2	0	a course which is difficult. I obviously don't think it's valid
2	0	Let's look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is. I have a difference with this president
0	1	If that isn't a liberal idea, I've never heard one. I think what we want to avoid is falling back into this nationalized health care system that President Clinton wanted to give us in 1993
2	0	I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up. She talks about health care.
2	0	if I'm President of the United States, when I'm President of the United States, we will stand with Israel. I actually wanted to sign that bill
2	0	He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq. I would use pressure and diplomacy
2	0	The Secretary of State admitted that this morning. that says if a teacher or principal upholds reasonable standards of classroom discipline they can't be sued
2	0	we believe that the government ought to do everything it can to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies. I think the housing community is ready
2	0	I think that racial profiling is a serious problem. I think Mr. Bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks
2	0	I'll put competent judges on the bench. An all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century
0	1	I know what it takes to get this to happen. my plan will do that
0	1	You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit. he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there
2	0	to double the number of drug enforcement agents. He was a fantastic governor of Missouri
0	1	if you have a state that fully supports the law like we do in Texas. we're going to go after all crime
2	0	that's not leadership. Prime Minister Allawi came here, and he said the terrorists are pouring over the border
0	1	I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law. I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws
2	0	Yes, we have an increase in the defense budget.. my plan has a better chance of standing up and fighting for those troops
0	1	There are 100,000 troops trained, police, guard, special units, border patrol. we're getting the job done
1	1	No, it's not. it's in your book. On page 304
2	0	that's not fair. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s
2	0	the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one. I want us to invest in your future
0	1	income is up to the Federal Government by 25 percent in the last three years. what I want to do is keep this expansion going
2	0	while Barack Obama was talking about reinstating those regulations, John on 20 different occasions in the previous year and a half called for more deregulation. I think that measures like these are important
2	0	The military aspect of the drug problem is being addressed. We're focusing our tax cut on the middle class in the areas they tell us they need it
2	0	I'm not going to make decisions that I think are wrong for America. this is a struggle in which we're engaged
2	0	We'll make sure they do not end up with weapons of mass destruction. I think I have experience that counts
0	1	not all of his health care initiative has been presented to the Congress even now. He really didn't have a new economic program until over 1300 days into his presidency
2	0	Now it's in over 30 countries. The sooner the better off we'll be, if you put tougher sanctions on Castro, not try to make it easier for him
2	0	we've got to maintain that pressure. I've supported all the education programs
0	1	He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution. I believe the president broke faith with the American people in the way that he took this nation to war
2	0	"Medical costs are up the highest they've ever been over the last four years. I'm a little offended by this word ""scheme"
2	0	We have to be able to compete in the world market. we still have a long way to go
2	0	He hasn't saved $9 billion with his vetoes. I've been heavily criticized
0	1	people know where I stand. I've shown the American people I know how to lead
2	0	It's been tried for 12 years and it's failed. The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself
2	0	It's time to have a leader that doesn't put off tomorrow what we should do today. that isn't good enough
2	0	I'd like to know what that means. we need to make sure that if we decontrol our plants that there's mandatory -- that the plants must conform to clean air standards, the grandfathered plants
0	1	I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt. we've got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently-which they have incurred and which is burdening them
2	0	have no doubt that Russia's behavior is certainly outside the norms of behavior that we would expect for nations which are very wealthy, as Russia has become. I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they’ve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices
2	0	Less dependency upon foreign sources of crude is good for consumers. Strength requires knowledge, command
2	0	I think it's going to require good, solid credit policies. He'll claim credit now for crime going down
2	0	if that quote was wrong. This doesn't have to be
0	1	they were on a public school ground. saying that children could not be interfered with in religious advocacy when they were praying, when they were doing whatever they could do under the constitution
2	0	We - uh believe that uh you can revise the federal criminal code. I couldn't do that to Ronald Reagan, now, next year or any other time.
0	1	I have so appreciated he has never asked me to check my opinions at the door and he wants a deliberative debate and healthy debate so we can make good policy. What I would do also, if that were to ever happen, though, is to continue the good work he is so committed to of putting government back on the side of the people
0	1	I remember you gave a very good answer to New Hampshire about the White Mountains, about how it was important to keep that collaborative effort in place. I feel very strongly the same place
2	0	the stature of our people, the meaning of the Constitution, in the future. Lloyd Bentsen jumped on Dan Quayle, when Dan Quayle said, he's had roughly the same amount of experience
0	1	some of them little, like appointments to boards you never heard of. some of them big
2	0	I want it to be streamlined. He wanted to give people rights
0	1	it's the working folks who send their sons and daughters to war, with a few exceptions. it is inappropriate for us, just because there's a problem somewhere around the world, to take the sons and daughters of working people
1	1	our commanding general did say that. Well, first, McClellan did not say definitively the surge principles would not work in Afghanistan
0	1	I think Mr. Lehrer, that throughout much of his career, Jack Kemp has been a powerful and needed voice against the kind of coarseness and incivility that you refer to in the question. Civility, responsibility, racial reconciliation, healing the wounds of our country has to be one of the greatest, most singularly important goals for this country here on the edge of the 21st Century
0	1	This is a matter of life and death. The President should lead a national effort to change behavior to keep our children alive in the schools, responsible behavior to keep people alive
0	1	to add nine million new jobs, to control inflation, and to plan for the future with an energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead. you have mentioned the creation of nine million new jobs
2	0	if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties,. I don't believe she does have the stamina
2	0	I see a situation where the Senator from Indiana has now jumped off the reservation. that's one of the real success stories here of the work we've done
0	1	Social Security is a trust fund that pays the checks this year with the money that is paid into Social Security this year. I think it should stay in a lockbox
0	1	Russia is still very unstable; they could go back to square one, and worse. we need to stay right on top of that and constructively help them move toward democracy and capitalism
1	1	he said that he wouldn't raise taxes again -- no, never, ever, ever. he went on to say he wanted to be the education president
2	0	those that I haven't been able to keep, it's not for lack of trying. the Ford administration has failed
1	1	America is not standing still. Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this - these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still
2	0	there are 1.4 million manufacturing jobs that have been lost. I'm cutting more than I'm spending so that it will be a net spending cut
0	1	Keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years. I think it's important to step back and think about what happened in Libya
2	0	That's just what the president did when he vetoed the Family Leave Act. Young people are looking to us
2	0	I'm here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare. he's got a record
2	0	I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all I've got is my Social Security and my Medicare, don't cut it. What we're going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology
2	0	not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas. people know where I stand
2	0	That's exactly right. I believe we've got the right ideas for the future
2	0	There are thousands of other examples. We're going to have to develop better community transportation systems
2	0	Muslims have to report the problems when they see them. He says he's going to give you tax cuts
2	0	No. Bill Clinton, when he was governor of Arkansas, also worked with the Right to Life people and supported Right to Life positions and now he has changed
2	0	let them see what kind of a country we have. He didn't
2	0	we didn't sit around. this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending.
2	0	I want to make sure the outcome honors that nobility. we will see it done work speed
2	0	If you are part of the -- of the bottom 20% or so of wage earners, then you will get an expanded earned income tax credit. the Ford administration has failed
2	0	I believe in it. We're lucky to have her heading the Commission
0	1	In fact, they raid the Medicare trust fund to pay for, well, their tax cut and other programs that they can't afford because they've spent so much on the tax cut. Our opponents do not do that
2	0	We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million. You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people
2	0	Social Security has never done that. I don't take that lightly
2	0	You're not for school choice. involve the Federal Government in such partnerships
0	1	They're most effective. Americans' workers are the best in the world
0	1	middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years. I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes
0	1	even before then the problem hits because the money contributed to Social Security this year is an entitlement. the money is used to pay the benefits for seniors this year
2	0	We need school choice. Now there's what's called an Independent Review Organization that you have to go through first
2	0	the focus should not be on the executive branch. it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation
2	0	It had nothing to do with us. I look back on those years as the beginning of wisdom, learning everything a man can learn about the vulnerabilities and the strengths that are ours as Americans
0	1	We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan, and we did deliver a surge of troops. That was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in Iraq
2	0	We helped our neighbor in an hour of need, and they survived. That's why we're pushing these income tax cuts for middle income families in the context of a balanced budget that protects important programs
0	1	if we assume that at the end of the four-year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent. under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does - my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh - and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year '81 which will be the last year of this next term
2	0	In 1974, we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree. this is a global effort
2	0	who has been tested. I readily admit I'm not going to grow the size of the federal government like he is
2	0	When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver. We did try to bring Saddam Hussein into the family of nations
2	0	That's progress with the environment. who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel
1	1	I just think I can do that far more effectively. we have to go after them and get them wherever they are
2	0	where it appears to be growing, it's minimum-wage jobs. I agree. I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon
0	1	We've made some progress during the last eight years. We have seen the strongest economy in the history of the United States
0	1	It wouldn't get to the age of 70 until the year 2103 according to the actuaries. Slowly raise the retirement age over time
1	1	it would even make the economy worse. to do it you'd have to raise taxes too much and cut benefits too much to people who need them
0	1	I've joined this team that is a team of mavericks with John McCain. where we're known for putting partisan politics aside to just get the job done
1	1	You didn’t get anything done.. We got a lot of it done.
2	0	Number two is to cut spending. when it comes to our military, what we have to think about is not, you know just budgets, we've got to think about capabilities
1	1	The first time, the first embassy, there was no gate up. what was the president's reaction
1	1	I think that should be eyed with great suspicion, people that are really kicking the props out from under our grand military establishment prematurely. we overcut the defense budget in the first place
2	0	I would hope by this time that Mr. Bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as I have. this is a vital mission
1	1	on surplus military equipment - we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos. I believe that in the ca- that it's far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world
0	1	I had a record of working with Republicans and Democrats as the governor of Texas. I'll continue, in the four years, to continue to try to work to do so
0	1	They didn't tell anybody. That's wrong
2	0	It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them
0	1	I'm proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that don't have as much pollution, that don't burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs. My plan has not only a short-term component, but also a long-term component
0	1	I defended this country as a young man in war. I will defend it as president of the United States
0	1	I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned. a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes
0	1	that's what America has been doing. we can get them all done
2	0	when it gets overextended, morale drops. The so-called Nixon shock against Japan had weakened our relationships there
1	1	The same thing would happen when you ration health care. Your program is to ration health care
2	0	Yes, it'll create bubble jobs. We had a BTU tax we turned into a $35 million gas tax, a $265 billion tax increase
0	1	Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh - made available. The bills that I vetoed, the one for an additional $6 billion, was not a bill that would have solved our unemployment problems
0	1	I am going to change this country and make it better, with the help of the American people. We've got a broad-based coalition that goes beyond party
2	0	your health requires it. I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference
0	1	I don't believe that our security would be directly threatened if the Soviet Union went uh - into Yugoslavia. I think it would be unwise for us to say that we will go to war uh - in Yugoslavia uh - if the Soviets should invade
2	0	that's not enough. I’ll be President of the United States, not Vice President of the United States.
1	1	I want to expand our markets abroad and that's why I've called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture. I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it and used food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country
2	0	we voted for the resolution. it's expensive
0	1	I believe we can be better.. That's what's wrong with Mr. Bush
1	1	Have you ever seen Washington more divided. The president said that he would unite this country
2	0	to step up to the plate. I think it's this pattern that troubles me, more than the draft
0	1	it's very difficult. I think fair-minded people that really understand international terror know that it's very hard to guard against
1	1	we, the living Americans, have gone through four wars. That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary.
2	0	Free nations will help us achieve the peace we all want. I take full responsibility for what happened in Somalia
0	1	At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. Middle-income families are being crushed
0	1	Proud that they voted for the right candidate. I want the voters to do is to make a decision
2	0	It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance. it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top
0	1	We need to have an active and aggressive action on the part of the president, the leader of his country, to seek out every possible way to get that information which has kept the MIA families in despair and doubt. that's not enough
1	1	That didn't work. Kofi Annan came in and said we're going to try to have a ceasefire
2	0	first of all, I have paid all the taxes that I owe. we have a long way to go in our intelligence services
0	1	you've got to have somebody in Washington who is thinking about the middle class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyists. You need somebody working for you
2	0	I did not think that that was the case. I have to defend the honor of my state
0	1	the Russians must understand that these kinds of actions and activities are not acceptable. the G-8 is one of those
2	0	the build-up of military forces is good for our country. He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills.
0	1	when people know there's a greater supply, then the cost of that will go down. it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil
2	0	It's a plan I put together with a prominent Democrat senator from Oregon. I have been for campaign reform, and have pushed it very hard
0	1	they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives. I believed they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future
0	1	Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti. We have worked hard for peace and freedom
2	0	he could have lowered the cost of Medicare and lowered your taxes and lowered the costs to seniors. I think Mr. Bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks
0	1	You look at, uh, Ferguson, you look at, or you go to very…many places.. it was more violent than what I’m even seeing now.
2	0	the idea of a terrorist in the middle of one of our cities with a nuclear weapon, is very real. they're matters of very deep conviction, as far as many, many people in this country believe
2	0	It's not good enough. let's live in a world of reality
0	1	I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline. we ought to take. put that tax on here at home
2	0	we care for them. whether or not you're using facts that aren't right
2	0	going back to Libya -- because this is an example of how we make choices. I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations
2	0	They are plotting to kill Americans right now. I don't think it's OK
2	0	I do it because it's the responsibility of leadership. I don't think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants
0	1	we've captured or killed thousands of Al Qaida and taken down the regimes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban. it's important that we stand up democratically elected governments as the only guarantee that they'll never again revert to terrorism or the production of deadly weapons
0	1	They wanted home ownership. I was at a housing sub -- a housing project in San Francisco several months ago and met with people that were trying to reclaim their neighborhood
2	0	it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney. We have considered inflation in our figures
0	1	even though Ambassador Smith and Ambassador Gardner, both Republican Ambassadors, both warned of Castro, the Marxist influences around Castro, the Communist influences around Castro, both of them have testified in the last six weeks, that in spite of their warnings to the American government, nothing was done. I say that not as the Democratic standard-bearer, but as a citizen of the United States who is concerned about the United States
0	1	Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America. I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure
0	1	today, we have about five hundred Georgians at their own expense - just working people who believe in me - spread around the country uh - involved in the political campaign. I have a direct relationship with hundreds of people around - hundreds of thousands around the country who actively campaign for me
2	0	Israel is our friend. I've even scaled back some of my favorite programs already, like the child-care program I wanted to fund and the national service program
1	1	I think that it's time that all parents in America have a right to choose where they send their kids to school to get an education. it's not okay for the middle class and the working poor to choose where they want to send their kids to school
0	1	we've got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn. We've got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with
2	0	over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it that's now paid by the state governments. I'm going to explain tonight how we're going to do all this and remain fiscally responsible
0	1	It says to you as a taxpayer -- say you're going to pay a tax of 1000 bucks or something. I think it's good
2	0	Obviously, we've poured billions of dollars into airport security. That’s why he wouldn’t meet with us.
2	0	90 percent of the coalition casualties, Mr. Vice President, the coalition casualties, are American casualties. There's not only what is on your paper resume that makes you qualified to run for or to hold office
2	0	Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them. please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be
2	0	Captain Miller is thankful. It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns
1	1	If you look, frankly, by our numbers and the numbers of the Senate Budget Committee, which has totaled up all the promises that Vice President Gore has made during the course of the campaign, they are some $900 billion in spending over and above that surplus already and we still have a month to go in the campaign. we're being fiscally responsible about it
2	0	Of course we're worried about Osama bin Laden. it's getting worse by the day
2	0	I have been in charge of this reinventing government streamlining project that's reduced the size of government by more than 300,000 people in the last several years. Bill Clinton prevented it from happening
0	1	When I was chairman of the finance committee which handled Social Security we looked at all these options. when I used to go home my mother would tell me all I've got is my Social Security, don't touch it
0	1	This current administration's worked hard to keep the parties at the table. I will try to do the same thing
2	0	I said then and I believe today that freedom does mean freedom for everybody. You raise taxes and you kill jobs
2	0	all of that can happen. the money goes to them
2	0	Your choice is nothing. I've made some mistakes
0	1	a $1600 drop in average income in just the last 2 years. People are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago, 2- 3rds of our people
2	0	we're not going to do it in that old Democratic, liberal way of trying to build more bricks and mortars. we cannot let America's parents stand alone in this competition that they feel they're in with Hollywood to raise their own kids and give their kids the faith and values they want to give them
2	0	I could suggest another choice that you have. Middle-income families are being crushed
2	0	If we don't resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant. whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York
0	1	if you're going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you'd better be prepared to pull the trigger. I'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan
2	0	I want to make sure that the Iranians are put enough -- that we put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining with our allies. I do not believe that we have a right to tell other people that -- women they can't control their body
0	1	we have never walked away from trying to require, acquire equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America.. It’s about equity and equality.
2	0	If you look, frankly, by our numbers and the numbers of the Senate Budget Committee, which has totaled up all the promises that Vice President Gore has made during the course of the campaign, they are some $900 billion in spending over and above that surplus already and we still have a month to go in the campaign. I think that we do
2	0	what I've done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts. I've been all over
2	0	Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy. the fact is, let's look at our records, Senator Obama
2	0	That's not true. The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully
2	0	I am. It's very simple for him to clear it up
2	0	you need to have a president that is qualified. the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug
2	0	we have 105 empowerment zones and enterprise communities all across the United States of America. what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this
2	0	No one making less than $250,000 under Barack Obama's plan will see one single penny of their tax raised whether it's their capital gains tax, their income tax, investment tax, any tax. I believe that a fresh start, new credibility, a president who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the Muslim world to make it clear that this is not
2	0	you don't believe we should be there in the first place. I am a person who keeps promises
2	0	I think if you raise taxes during a recession, you head to depression. And in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they'd -- they'd built up
0	1	It requires taking as much as a trillion dollars out of the Social Security fund. The deeper I got the drier the well became and it seemed to me at the end it was going to dry up Social Security
1	1	We want competition.You will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada
2	0	I'm strongly against a- abortion. I don't think there's any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which we've abandoned so much in this country
2	0	We're going to cover all kids. I just believe it's time to change
0	1	That's what a governor gets to do. A governor gets to name supreme court judges
2	0	A two-state solution, building our embassy, also, in Jerusalem, those things that we look forward to being able to accomplish. It ought not to be a strength of bombast and threats
2	0	we'll stand by Israel. I - I accomplished this with s - substantial reductions in employees in some departments
0	1	if we have the right vision and the right restraint and the right leadership. These things can be done
2	0	I’m going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people.. the kind of programs that I've talked about, in my judgment, are uh - fiscally sound.
1	1	There are 357, 000 good jobs -- manufacturing jobs, which are lost. that's one of the real success stories here of the work we've done
2	0	so many of them depend on it for their basic living, for their livelihood. I also want to make sure that we get this economy going
0	1	we can overcome it. All of these things we can do as Americans
2	0	I'm not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights.. the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court
2	0	I hope it isn't Christmas when you make that decision. An issue like that taken up by a presidential candidate goes beyond naivete and goes beyond poor judgment
0	1	"Senator Obama, your campaign has used words like ""erratic,"" ""out of touch,"" ""lie,"" ""angry,"" ""losing his bearings"" to describe Senator McCain. Both of you pledged to take the high road in this campaign yet it has turned very nasty"
2	0	you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not. It's time for a fresh star
2	0	No, they took that into account in those figures. I think that we have to recognize that while we've made enormous progress in the U.S. in racial relations and come a great long way, we still have a very long way to go
2	0	That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor. that we would have worked more aggressively with our friend and with other friends in the region to have them make the transition towards a more representative form of government, such that it didn't explode in the way that it did
0	1	I have a plan that will take the catastrophic cases out of the system, off your backs. I have a plan
2	0	it's three or four times as high as it is - as it is in Japan. we're going to hunt them down
0	1	any issue that comes before me. I don't want to hear them
0	1	A Clinton is, is what he says -- he says one thing one day and another thing the next day -- you try to have both sides of the issues. you are proposing $150 billion in new taxes
0	1	she’d love to have some victories on a date called November 3rd.. Nancy Pelosi doesn’t want to approve anything
2	0	I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here. I object to that part of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill which I think is very unfair and would prove to be so. That is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of an employee before they're hired
2	0	we're meeting our obligation to our veterans. We've got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care
2	0	it would have. During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States
0	1	We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us. we seek no superiority
0	1	That's what it's meant to do. Our military is meant to fight and win war
0	1	maybe you could understand it a lot better. you ought to travel down there and visit them
1	1	I'm going to give you a tax cut. The president gave the top 1 percent of income-earners in America, got $89 billion last year, more than the 80 percent of people who earn $100,000 or less all put together
0	1	The next four years we will continue to strengthen our homeland defenses. That's not going to happen, so long as I'm your president
2	0	I am not going to raise taxes. to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained
2	0	maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.. Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh - government uh - plants
2	0	They want to know that they have good judgment. Al and I have committed to putting that Social Security surplus in a lockbox, not touching it
2	0	Teachers' salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries.. what you're seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism
2	0	Wrote the crime bill. I offer a new approach. It's not trickle down economics
2	0	In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes. Until we control health care costs, we're not going to control the deficit
2	0	I believe that the Federal government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives. We're not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere
2	0	notice she said she has a new good accountant. I'd like to get his name and phone number. I'm for opportunity, responsibility and community
2	0	they've understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we're all stronger. You know, people said it was a big risk at that time
1	1	I have voted in the last uh - eight years. Senator Kennedy's is there for the people to consider.
0	1	He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan. I'm not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do
2	0	I've just gotten a report from the Air Force that indicates that the 30-year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be $100 billion. no one will go without food
1	1	What he's quoting is not the Senate Budget Commiitte. he'll either have to raise your taxes by $900 billion or go into the Social Security surplus for $900 billion
0	1	we'd be a - doing a much tougher job of auditing, to try to get rid of some of these kickbacks to consultants on military contracts, to be much more aggressive on that. I'd try to turn this trade deficit around and that too would help us and help us very substantially
2	0	This is at the EPA. Where we enter into a bargain with businesses. character is an important part of the equation
0	1	Under the Medicare prescription drug proposal I'm making, here is how it works, you go to your own doctor. Your doctor chooses your prescription
2	0	put our people back to work. he has a responsibility to be accurate, and not to misstate the case
2	0	It's not. it was a lame attempt at a joke and yours was a lame attempt at a joke, too, I guess
2	0	She talks about taxes. if you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover
2	0	regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality our water and our land. we don't have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education
0	1	All over the world, people are being torn apart. one of the things I've tried hardest to do is to tell the American people that we have to get beyond that
2	0	there is a problem in the sense that there are some problem banks. If you like your high premiums, you keep them
2	0	we can create 700,000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030. it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party -- or the six-point cease-fire
2	0	it's easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign. I think the President owes it to family values to show that he values America's families
0	1	We can help people to live better lives. save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare
2	0	Our country is not strong anymore. it's only temporary
2	0	In fact, you said in fact that you wanted to run, you'd be honored to run with him on the ticket. Reform of government is coming
2	0	Once you have a policy, then you have to go out and be aggressive and enforce that policy. It denigrates an alliance to say we're going alone, to discount their sacrifices
2	0	contrary to what everyone in America sees on their television every day. This is a government that is not serving you
2	0	as we did in Social Security in 1983, when we rescued Social Security, and I was proud to be on that commission, along with Claude Pepper, the champion of senior citizens from Florida. If somebody sees a silver lining, he finds a big black cloud out there.
0	1	I think we need to continue to be uh - strong and uh - I would certainly uh - pursue the uh - normalization of uh - relationships with the People's Republic of China. we will continue to move for normalization of relations in the traditional sense
0	1	refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on 9/11. that's what we've done over the last four years
2	0	We've got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can't afford to live in the communities that they grew up in. they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa - in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa
2	0	I don't believe that it's in the best interest of the United States and the NATO nations to have a Communist government in NATO. the responsibility was in coddling Saddam Hussein when there was no reason to do it
0	1	I never made that statement; never would. That simply isn't true
2	0	they have been able to establish a democratic government. In analyzing the figures we will find that our unemployment exists among the older citizens
2	0	we can do much, much better if we have the courage to change. I think that in the aftermath of the Cold War, it's time for us to do something very similar
1	1	Senator Dole has gone back and forth about whether he'd be for repealing the Brady Bill or repealing the assault weapons ban. Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill
2	0	He believes in deregulation in every circumstance. I believe what you need to do is some of what Ross is talking about: control the growth of mandatory spending and get taxes down
0	1	to work with our neighbors in this hemisphere. We have work to do to fight a real war, not a phony war, against drugs
0	1	Sure I do. I'm going to give a new direction to this economy in this country
2	0	I will be a president for all of our people. he doesn’t
0	1	Last year, we had an almost $800 billion trade deficit. We had an $800 billion deficit.
0	1	" I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, ""See the house over? We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK-47 lying on the bed right beside him. They don't want to go into a drug bust and be facing an AK-47"
2	0	We've got four children. Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after Bin Laden
2	0	He's ruled out revenue. I've done a lot of things that were controversial
2	0	I'm for continued research. There's a good program
2	0	She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. if we're going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers, people who are hurting the community
2	0	We absolutely have to make more progress. We've increased VA funding by $22 billion in the four years since I've been president
0	1	I am putting pro-life justices on the court. that'll happen automatically
2	0	What he did was he issued a challenge to the Soviet Union. I, first of all, oppose an election year tax cut
0	1	I think so. it's all a question of what our priorities are
0	1	He chose a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans over getting that equipment out into the homeland as fast as possible. This president chose a tax cut over homeland security
2	0	I guess the concern that I have is a concern not only as a vice-presidential candidate but as a citizen in this country. They don't need the vice president or the president to tell them what they saw
2	0	unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger. His targeted tax cut is so detailed, so much fine print
2	0	We haven't done that. I think it's important to make voting more accessible
2	0	I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth. 900,000 small businesses will be taxed under his plan
0	1	Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses. Small business is where jobs come from
1	1	We can. Can we send Mary back to school next semester
0	1	to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education, home buying or medical expenses. that's the right way to go into the 21st Century
0	1	I think it's very difficult. we need campaign finance reform
0	1	which was killed for this session by a filibuster in the Senate, mostly be Republican senators. I think it's a shame it didn't pass
2	0	The Soviet Union has been moving faster than we have.. We fought against it
1	1	he cut defense $112 billion. the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion
0	1	Here's some help for you to go to a community college. I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century
0	1	He would never reduce benefits. Everybody remembers that
0	1	More than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration. But are the American people?
0	1	that they question his legitimacy. just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia
2	0	That's what I've been critical about the administration for.. The next four years we will continue to strengthen our homeland defenses
0	1	Personal income has dropped while people have worked harder. I think the American people deserve better than they're getting
2	0	the problem is that they didn't think these things through properly. I believe, as the president indicated, and said at the time that I supported his -- his action there
0	1	it's hard work to try to love her as best as I can, knowing full well that the decision I made caused her loved one to be in harm's way. I thought her husband's sacrifice was noble and worthy
2	0	Governor Carter's answer tonight does not coincide with the answer that he gave in an interview to the Associated Press a week or so ago. I think we can do that in a way that represents what America is all about
2	0	an education system that raises standards. the situation was ended
0	1	It is about the potential of the American people to lift themselves up and not have their lives controlled by the United States Government and Washington. Bob Dole and I believe we can do a lot better
0	1	it is one of the things I've learned in the White House, is that there's enormous pressure on the president. he cannot wilt under that pressure
0	1	when you say what the American people have done over these last eight months hasn’t worked. that’s a great disservice to the sacrifices the American people have made
1	1	We have to help these nations create civil societies. they're throughout many nations in the Middle East
2	0	they didn't want him to be furloughed again. stop-and-frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City
1	1	Well, why did John vote 20 times?. the governor says John is for everything
2	0	until women are receiving the same amount of pay for the same job they're doing as a man receives. I'm not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food - some of it rotting
2	0	and cut the capital gains rate. we did work on this, alongside working on jobs
0	1	The negotiations far the Panama Canal started under President Johnson and have continued up to the present time. I believe those negotiations should continue
1	1	I think America is seeing right now the reason this nation is in gridlock. That qualifies you for being president of the US.
2	0	We have people with no property. 50 national security officials who served in Republican information—in administrations have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief
0	1	I have one. We all have tempers
0	1	We can lead NATO if we're willing to take a hard stand. We should rally the world to act and we should demonstrate it by our own movement to provide the helicopters to get the 21,000 forces of the African Union in there now to stop this genocide
2	0	Let's get him working on Syria, their client state, and see if we can't get them to join Israel and other Arab nations, if at all possible, and Arab leaders, in finally bringing peace to that troubled region. That's what John McCain has been known for in all these years
0	1	It has gone up. I don't think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector
2	0	I truly take an oath as a public official to represent all the people in my district, not only the Catholics. The people pay it
1	1	How can we trust an administration that, all of a sudden, four years into or the last year of its four years tells us that now they're going to follow through on the promise they made four years ago. That's why we're pushing these income tax cuts for middle income families in the context of a balanced budget that protects important programs
2	0	I think then you're going to see that people are put out of work. That makes them less safe
0	1	we'll get the rest of that tax relief. I've got a plan that's been out there for two years, it could have been passed already
0	1	Amnesty means that - that you uh - that what you did was right. There's a difference in my opinion
0	1	just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. I don't think you can deny that
2	0	No, and Dr. Henry Kissinger especially. Senator, frankly, you have a record in the Senate that's not very distinguished
2	0	there should be all of the protection that we can give for an unborn human being. the agencies need to recruit and to work hard to find people to bid on the state contracts
2	0	Bill Clinton is opposed to it. That's twice the amount of rate of return than the current Social Security Trust
0	1	Obviously, we've poured billions of dollars into airport security. I think that we are safer in some ways
0	1	94% comes from the local level. education is really funded at the local level
2	0	They're coming here to work. We are determined to move forward during these next four years, with the tax cuts that president Bill Clinton has proposed
2	0	They're the ones who have been for the Patriot Act and against it, for No Child Left Behind and then against it. The President was opposed to it in 1993
0	1	We should double the rate of growth and double the size of American economy. we have to hold down the growth in entitlement spending
0	1	this rescue package means that we will stabilize markets, we will shore up these institutions. I believe that it's rescue
2	0	the greed and excess in Washington and Wall Street, Main Street was paying a very heavy price. then you've seen an administration that came in and really didn't have it's heart in that kind of an enforcement
0	1	it requires steadfast determination. it requires a complete understanding that we not only chase down Al Qaida but we disrupt terrorist safe havens as well as people who could provide the terrorists with support
2	0	the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources. that's not what you've done in the last four years
2	0	the choice isn't the environment and jobs. It is a welfare system that is more like a third-world socialist country than what we would expect from the world's greatest democratic free-enterprise system
2	0	there's no market forces involved with health care. That's exactly what we're doing
0	1	the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well. if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region
0	1	I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin. We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin
0	1	They're going to expand their companies. I'm really calling for major jobs
0	1	that's the central front on terrorism. I think it's so important for us to reverse course
0	1	Obamacare was the first step. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years
2	0	I was there the day it ended. It's going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people
2	0	we can have a tax cut. A promise made will be a promise kept
0	1	I'm for that proposed law. I know what a hate crime statute pending at the national level is all about in the aftermath of James Byrd's death
2	0	They tested a nuke. he can't tell the truth
2	0	Seventy-five percent of known Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice. He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain
2	0	Whether or not it's -- the same in domestic policy as well. I offer a new approach. It's not trickle down economics
0	1	that's what's happening here. what we also want it do is make sure that we're not projecting weakness abroad
0	1	Until we got a Republican Congress, we finally got action. I'm proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done
2	0	We also agree and believe and pledge that the surplus in the Medicare trust fund should also be locked up with a sign on it that says politicians keep your hands off. Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs
2	0	when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. In this cold war we have to recognize where it is being fought and then we have to develop programs to deal with it
2	0	I left my campaign and suspended it to go back to Washington. they’ll probably blame him
2	0	We can't continue to shuffle children through school. I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century
1	1	he would wait until after the election to do it. Medicare will be saved
1	1	I think it's the attitude. I don't think it's the issues that turn kids off
2	0	I think it's the tone. Let's give them a real choice
2	0	that's not the facts. I keep my word, and you will have a tax cut
0	1	He didn't. He broke his word
0	1	I'd say rather than just yelling at one another, why don't we find out where we're apart. That's the way I would do it
2	0	Civil rights - uh has been confirmed by the Burger Court, hasn't been uh - reversed. I fundamentally disagree with that
2	0	When a country engages in genocide, when a country engaging in harboring terrorists and will do nothing about it, at that point that country in my view and Barack's view forfeits their right to say you have no right to intervene at all. The president has been tested
2	0	if you're a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it's 11 percent tax versus 35 percent. I will be prepared to do that
0	1	It's wrong. It's nothing but a political tool
0	1	I don't think they ought to be held guilty. I do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, get it done
2	0	It would've been inconceivable ten - fifteen years ago, for us to be brought to our knees with an Arab oil embargo. you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto
1	1	After 9/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us. obviously we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use force
2	0	Al Gore and I view Social Security as probably the best thing the government did in the second half -- the last century. I'm going to change that
2	0	That's the kind of leadership that we need to show. those huge tax breaks aren't coming to the big multinational corporations anymore
2	0	They risk their lives every day to take care of us.. It is the direct result of the failures of this administration
2	0	then said it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise effort with the Congress. You've got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed
2	0	I'm not even certain you were too excited about that. I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care
0	1	They don't even fight to reach those goals. They've tried to undo them
0	1	our values are violently contradicted by the kind of racial profiling that I know exists. the first Civil Rights Act legislation we would send to Congress would be a national ban on racial profiling
0	1	the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people. we need law and order in the inner cities
0	1	I still believe that there is some discrimination. I'm against giving anybody any kind of preference for something they're not qualified for
2	0	four years closer to a nuclear weapon. you've got to have a government that comes from you again
2	0	That civility cannot return to our country unless every person feels that they have an equal shot at the American dream. I don't think we're meeting our obligations toward these Americans.
2	0	We have people who are unemployed. The rest either abstained or voted against us
1	1	We should export the technology by investing in clean coal technology. It's polluting not only the atmosphere but the West Coast of the United States
2	0	making certain that self-employed people that are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of you pay for premiums. I see a man who is young
2	0	I just told you about this manufacturing job loss which is going to increase. how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do.
1	1	spending money without a strategic plan can oftentimes be wasted. Spending money is one thing
0	1	We're ahead of our six-year schedule. We've already got 20,000 out there
2	0	I don't think so. You got to send down some more people, because the president's found out there are death squads on his on his, in his own property
2	0	I mean, there's a lot going on, a lotta opportunity. the government negotiating with the United States government for their release
2	0	so they can take their child to a -- to a school that he's being more successful. you've been bombarded with advertisements suggesting that I've changed a position on this or that or the other
2	0	if you don't think that this course that we've been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four. I shouldn't have a preference
0	1	leave this country in good shape. We've got to collect the taxes to do it
2	0	maybe that explains why he hasn't fully funded the VA and the VA hospital is having trouble and veterans are complaining. the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion.
2	0	they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000. we never would have got there
2	0	It brought the crime rate way down. if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it
2	0	Civil rights -- we're for it so long as it's voluntary. In the last uh - two weeks, I've had a chance to talk to uh - two men who have visited uh - the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and China
2	0	if the Congress won't do it, if they can't get together and negotiate how to do that, then you'd have a sequester across the board. we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that aren't and eliminate them
0	1	I think that he just said that freedom is a gift from the Almighty. Everything is a gift from the Almighty
2	0	That is not the way you deal with the Soviets. it's getting worse by the day
2	0	for the last, almost a decade, we've worried about our schools officially through Washington. People who are working hard every day, paying payroll tax, gas taxes
1	1	You can't have the president of the United States out there looking over his shoulder wondering whether his vice president is going to be supporting him.. Mrs. Ferraro has quite a few differences with Vice-President Mondale
0	1	if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we'll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground. If we fail, it's been a great serious failure for everyone - for the human race
2	0	It basically protected states from the action of one state to another. Let's have a three-day waiting period
2	0	Now, hundreds, thousands of good, decent people, whole cities up here in this state are adversely impacted because they would not move in a timely way. It's just not credible to say he's going to keep taxes down and balance budgets
2	0	use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security. These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people
2	0	I'm not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. That's where the agreement ends
2	0	I've laid out a plan by which I think we can be successful in Iraq. I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress.
2	0	you in turn have voted against them time and time again. $90 billion in green pork to campaign contributors and special interest groups
0	1	Arab nations and the Israelis trust the United States, we were able to take the lead in the Sinai II Agreement. I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important
0	1	I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan. I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending
0	1	Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison cell. America and the world are safer for it
0	1	We're facing a group of folks who have such hatred in their heart, they'll strike anywhere, with any means. this is a global effort
2	0	we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system. In some circumstances
0	1	The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.. I think it cannot work
0	1	28 years ago, as a young man just graduated from law school, I came to this city, came clear across the country, to watch John Kennedy be nominated for the presidency of the United States, right here in Los Angeles. I never dreamed that some day I would win that nomination and be my party's nominee for president. I'm proud and grateful to be a citizen of this country
0	1	Instead of listening to him, they retired him. They avoided even the advice of their own general
2	0	I’ll give you an example. they should be paying us
0	1	President Clinton opposes term limits, President Clinton opposes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. There are some very fundamental differences in this campaign
0	1	I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to. I will keep this nation strong
0	1	That's a decision that only a woman can make. I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision
2	0	She’s got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States. I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken
2	0	it seems to me that there should have - be an opportunity, uh - as long as it's voluntary, as long as there is no uh - compulsion whatsoever, that uh - an individual ought to have that right. we walked away from the work of 160 nations over 10 years
1	1	I think Mr. Kemp has unintentionally made a mistake in saying that President Clinton called for reduction of -- to 6 percent or whatever you said. The President himself suggested that the reduction in the growth of Medicare over the next five or six years ought to be held to 6 percent under the Republican plan, irrespective of the numbers, it will grow at 7 or even more percent
1	1	"the lines of stem cells that he's made available, every scientist in the country will tell you, ""Not adequate,"" because they're contaminated by mouse cells, and because there aren't 60 or 70 -- they're are only about 11 to 20 now -- and there aren't enough to be able to do the research because they're contaminated. I made the decision we wouldn't spend any more money beyond the 70 lines, 22 of which are now in action"
2	0	the most significant accomplishments of this administration in which Al Gore was centrally involved were the result, most of them, of bipartisan agreements. the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes
2	0	you cannot keep both promises. That's why we don't have full employment today
2	0	We'll have 125,000 trained by the end of December. there will be a federal consequence
2	0	I've worked hard to help families impart values to their own children. I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there
2	0	I believe that life begins at conception. judge the man on his record not on the-lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name
2	0	four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about. It’s been out there.
2	0	the government doesn't create jobs. when you hear him say we're going to tax only the rich, watch your wallet
0	1	You had loan officers were -- that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because the folks didn't qualify. it wasn't just on Wall Street
2	0	it's growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement. That is a record of promises made and promises kept
2	0	The biggest campaign contributors to your campaign are the trial lawyers of America. Mr. Bush wants to spend billions and trillions on Star Wars
2	0	We had 25 fighter wings. these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives
0	1	Elected to the United States Senate when I was 33. what have I - going to do with my life
2	0	I think the press can play a huge roll in making sure that the backgrounds are clearly presented in an objective way. It's just not credible
2	0	that would mean a cutback in the Soviet program; it would not interfere with our own program. You do
0	1	when you have freedom fighters that want to protect that revolution, and go the democratic route. we believe in giving them support
0	1	we’re doing record numbers. We have to make our country totally successful
0	1	Romney points out 47 percent of the people won't take responsibility. you probably detected my frustration with their attitude about the American people
0	1	this was a standard answer that I made in response to the Yugoslavian question. I would never uh - go to war or become militarily involved, in the internal affairs of another country unless our own security was direc- rectly threatened
1	1	we have a genuine coalition to get this job done. The president says that I'm denigrating these troops
2	0	I will fight to create more energy in this country, to get America energy secure. I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way
2	0	he voted against my improved student loan plan. In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower's Administration, this situation has been reversed
2	0	we're going to do a lot more of it, if we have the opportunity with the help of the American people. I don't rule out modernization
2	0	there are allegations that they're too weak to do it. we did cut the increase in spending in half
2	0	he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen. He said he did the right thing then, he knew it wouldn't work at the time
1	1	We need a program for the uninsured. There is an issue with the uninsured, there sure is
2	0	recall when Vice President Bush was running in the primary against President Reagan and he called the program voodoo economics. I have always opposed drawing a line
1	1	There are empowerment zones, but you have to do what Bill Clinton and Al Gore want you to do. we did put an empowerment zone in South Central, Los Angeles
0	1	It's called bait and switch. It's an empty promise
2	0	drilling offshore and nuclear power are two vital elements of that. the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much
0	1	a half-a-trillion dollars we owe China. Government spending has gone completely out of control
0	1	It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is. this means more than what we've been doing
2	0	In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea. the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan's recovery created twice as many jobs as this president's recovery
2	0	just as I never faulted Jesse Jackson from taking his message to the black pulpits all across this country. we ought to be prepared to provide those funds
2	0	to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source of energy in the future. It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice
0	1	If we make the use of a gun in the commission. of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted. in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason
2	0	not crushing it. Look, we have spent more money -- we spend more money in three weeks on combat in Iraq than we spent on the entirety of the last seven years that we have been in Afghanistan building that country
1	1	People are going to come in from Syria. She wants open borders
2	0	Cleaning up two-thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps. If we continue under Mr. Ford's policy by 1985 or '90 we'll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons
0	1	I'm a big proponent of clean coal technology. I'm a good steward of the land
2	0	everyone in the world knows that there were no weapons of mass destruction. I want this nation to protect its air, its water, its land, and its public health
0	1	Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this. it's much clearer for me now
2	0	I want you to be on my team. I've done the job
2	0	We invest.. a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11
0	1	All of them voted for freedom - a free type of government. Let's look at Africa Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration Not one of them selected a Communist government
2	0	You ought to talk to the coal miners. how do we expect to be able to implement those
0	1	where I come from, overseas, which is Lake Superior, the Canadians, they dropped their tax rates to 15 percent. we need fundamental tax reform
0	1	It is not a government takeover. You have choice
0	1	I'm using the same words that your advisers use. I am not parsing words
0	1	it would be the most extreme version. the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again
2	0	Some of the hardest moments since I've been the governor of the State of Texas is to deal with those cases. We cannot afford to lose against al Qaeda and the Shia extremists who are still there, still fighting us
2	0	you could lower taxes for everyone. We have to find ways to get a handle on it
2	0	We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income. If you look at our opponent's tax proposal, they discriminate between stay-at-home moms with children that they take care of themselves and those who go to work or who, in fact, have their kids taken care of outside the home
2	0	we've stood still here at home. It will require some funds
2	0	the plan that he has outlined is the one we've been following for quite some time, including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contadora group. in terms of peace, we are on the right track
2	0	what he's saying about my program is just not true. I thought it was in our strategic interests to keep Milosevic in check
0	1	The worst inflation since the Great Depression. we, in this country, have let our economy go down the drain
0	1	That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record.. That is wholly wrong, wholly in error,
0	1	They're having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments. We haven't been paying attention to them
2	0	That we must share in an ever-increasing scarcity.. China is paying a lot.
2	0	we believe that during the early stages of a pregnancy the government has no business coming in and ordering a woman to do what the government thinks is best. It will not be our ambition that will determine it
1	1	you cannot keep both promises. the trillion dollars that has been promised to young people has also been promised to older people
2	0	I certainly hope there is one. that's an invitation to disaster
1	1	He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s
2	0	The president has a great responsibility. Our jobs are fleeing the country
2	0	I wanted them to move ahead. when Senator McCain proposes a $300 billion tax cut, a continuation not only of the Bush tax cuts
2	0	this administration doesn't believe the way to reduce unemployment is to go to war, or to increase the number of people in the military. So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested -- a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission
0	1	we disagree on this. I will fight for a clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy
0	1	If you make less than $30,000 a year and you put $500 in a savings account, the federal government will match it with $1500. If you make more than $60,000 and up to 100 you'll still get a match
0	1	we're going to go after all crime. that's what's gonna happen in the State of Texas
0	1	we're at $200 billion and counting. It is the direct result of the failures of this administration
2	0	I have budgeted for that. we're going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild the relationship with u
2	0	Mr. Bush was a lot more sympathetic to the freeze than he seems to be today. this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision-making process on health care
2	0	in that 90- day period before the inauguration, put together the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas present. I am a person who keeps promises
0	1	we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past. we have to learn from the past
2	0	it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation. that just isn't true
2	0	It will not be a re-ignition of the Cold War. the other superpowers need to do their part
1	1	I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem. Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I'm for it
0	1	I supported welfare reform. Labels don't mean anything
0	1	"I don't want to send troops any place. But I am not going to pick out one and, in advance, hypothetically say, ""Oh, yes, we would send troops there"
0	1	to make sure that they're treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown. across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries
0	1	For instance, we uh - completely revised our prison system. it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services
2	0	that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan. that composite now is going to be built around the bridges on the Santa Monica Freeway to help minimize the impact of earthquakes and create more jobs
0	1	I never met Putin. Of course I condemn
0	1	tax cuts for health care. we're going to do is roll back tax cuts
0	1	regulation can become excessive. what's happened with some of the legislation that's been passed during the president's term, you've seen regulation become excessive, and it's hurt -- it's hurt the economy
2	0	from those five, I always chose the first one or second one. which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier.
2	0	they provide us energy and they provide us innovation and they start companies like Intel and Google. You've got to go to the people
0	1	We have to work with the police. So we have to do two things, as I said
2	0	which lowers the premiums for everybody in America. That's my big difference with him on the draf
2	0	I was shot down when I was a young kid, scared to death. I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America
2	0	The drought highlighted the problem that we have. I'm just gonna tell you what the real facts are
1	1	We do not spend a higher percentage of our income on public education than every other country. now we spend more than any other nation in the world -- 199 billion a year -- and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of education achievement
2	0	I live in a beautiful house that's my total investment that I have. they deserve our support
0	1	we should be continually alert.. I think it's a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to.
2	0	we have John McCain to thank for at least warning people. I'm proud of it
0	1	The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous. I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament - including nuclear testing
2	0	on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans. this talk about this -- this weakness. I -- I don't understand what my friend's talking about here
2	0	they're now back in helping with elections. we are in trouble
2	0	They spend too much money on themselves. While I was governor, I was proud that our fourth graders came out number one of all 50 states in English, and then also in math
2	0	They want to know that they have good judgment. the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute.
2	0	We should give a tax cut, targeted to child rearing and education, to buying a first home and paying for health care. I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform
1	1	he could have lowered the cost of Medicare and lowered your taxes and lowered the costs to seniors. He made it illegal, illegal for Medicare to do what the V.A. does, which is bulk purchase drugs so that you can lower the price and get them out to you lower
2	0	everything he just said is absolutely false. I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes
2	0	We  've had eight years of talk but no action. Started off as a humanitarian mission and it changed into a nation-building mission
2	0	I'm not here to argue about the President with some ongoing foreign policy matter. It is the bipartisan bill that is now pending in the Congress
2	0	I think America is seeing right now the reason this nation is in gridlock. He said he just discovered that most Soviet missiles are on land, and that's why his proposal didn't work
2	0	My life has been dedicated to equality of opportunity and our democracy should provide that, not equality of reward. we have two fundamentally different visions of America
0	1	If you look at New York where it’s going up. like nobody’s ever seen anything.
2	0	Cutting our education budget, that's not a smart choice. there is a lot wrong with America
1	1	I think there ought to be parental notification laws. He's against them
0	1	We won a majority. I voted against that at the National Governors Association
0	1	seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions. I want to go further
2	0	We heard Senator Kerry say the other night that there ought to be some kind of global test before U.S. troops are deployed preemptively to protect the United States. we're telling our children and all future generations that we weren't willing to face up to this obligation
0	1	Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal. he should be held accountable for his actions
2	0	my strategy is broader than that. Bill Clinton, as President, has provided that kind of leadership
1	1	I'm fighting to let you get those drugs from Canada. He did block it
2	0	There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country. this is where I have a big difference
2	0	I said, ‘I think you need more’.. Governor Clinton clicked off the things: You've got to take on insurance companies and bureaucracies
2	0	that's one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America. because people are so hungry for those domestic sources of energy to be tapped into
0	1	pass on the American dream to them. We've got to collect the taxes to do it
2	0	This is a difficult and sensitive matter. we have just heard two or three times from the vice president: he's not going to raise taxes
2	0	I believe we ought to measure a lot, three, four, five, six, seven, eighth grade. This is the most important election you will ever, ever have voted in, any of you, since 1932
2	0	I could do a better job. I've touched more people's lives and seen more heartbreak and hope, more pain and more promise, than anybody else who's run for president this year
0	1	This president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment. all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief
2	0	there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran. they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them
0	1	I feel very strongly about that. Tipper and I have worked on the problem of violence in entertainment aimed at children
1	1	it's the Soviets who left the table. we wish they would think anew and move forward to verification so everybody would know whether the other side was keeping its word
0	1	they weren't running for president. in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh - interview had I do it - had it - I to do it over again
0	1	you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America. I think he's right
0	1	We didn't guard the foreign office, where you might have found information about weapons of mass destruction. There's a sense of American occupation
2	0	One is to control nuclear weapons. When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch
0	1	I want a country where people are coming together across the lines of race and region and income. I just believe it's time to change
0	1	I didn't say we had the worst education in the world. I didn't make most of the statements that you said I made
2	0	he vetoed it. I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it
0	1	as I have acted responsibly throughout my military career and throughout my career in the United States Senate. I'm going to act responsibly
0	1	I know all about poverty and all about need and all about taking care of people. I'll keep my word on the economic package
0	1	the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction,. I favor higher salaries for teachers.
2	0	One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh - New York City is to - is to finance welfare. We made it better
0	1	That will strengthen us and weaken them when it comes to issues like Georgia.. Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia
2	0	What that would do is it would give us the opportunity to sit down and negotiate a treaty. which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated
2	0	I have seen Communist influence and Castro influence rise in Latin America. It's not going to work if we open up a dialogue with Kim Jong Il
2	0	that's exactly what it would be. we committed ourselves to take strong action against terrorism
2	0	You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen. you've got to make up your mind
0	1	I would never do anything that would increase the taxes for those who work for a living, or who are presently required to list all their income. I think that would be a - a very serious mistake
2	0	I don't know of a city in America that doesn't have the kind of problems you're talking about. the polls to me are interesting, but they don't determine, you know, my hopes or - or my despair
2	0	You have to learn from experience that making unilateral cuts in defense system is not the way that you enhance peace. I don't trust the federal government
0	1	I'd just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get. I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan
2	0	I know that the only way he can win is to make everybody believe the economy's worse than it is. My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank
2	0	One-third of our public schools are failing under this administration. 50 national security officials who served in Republican information—in administrations have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief
2	0	And that's what John McCain and I would engage in also. They end up being worse than the people
0	1	As soon as she releases them, I will release. I will release my tax returns
2	0	We think that the protection of job safety in the workplace is very, very important, but what we've said is look, start, start measuring the results.. he's called that
2	0	there is no connection between Saddam Hussein and the attacks of September 11th -- period. I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor's programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan
2	0	The average family in America, at median level of income, probably is spending 25 to 26 percent of their income sent to the federal government. No one should be going to jail
2	0	they know the future lies, the future lies in us being able to breathe.. the American people are fair
2	0	they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment. our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level
2	0	Change is coming. This doesn't strengthen us
2	0	I'll do everything I can as president to stop the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries. the story, I think, is a good one
0	1	She’s got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States. It’s a horrible thing she’s doing
1	1	we need to get on to the business of having a plan to develop our domestic energy resources in producing more supplies. this administration hasn't produced them
2	0	That is a fundamental difference that I have with Senator McCain. I'm proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done
1	1	They don’t come back. What he’s telling you is simply not true.
2	0	That conference has met six times.. I would come up with a game plan to deal with it
2	0	it would have. if we continue with these policies, this trillion and a half dollars worth of new debt that's already been added on the backs of the American taxpayer is going to increase even more
2	0	I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years,. we're meeting our obligation to our veterans
1	1	according to the statistics coming from the Bush-Quayle Labor Dept, for the last 2 years in a role Bill Clinton's state has been number one among all 50 in the creation of jobs in the private sector. By contrast, in the nation as a whole, during the last 4 years, it is the first time since the presidency of Herbert Hoover, that we have gone for a 4-year period with fewer jobs at the end of that 4-year period than we had at the beginning
2	0	I feel very strongly about a lot of things. I think the American people would be willing to make those sacrifices for peace and prosperity in the next uh - four years
0	1	Senator McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets. so while it's true that nobody's completely innocent here, we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history
2	0	we're not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street. I'll put that label on it
0	1	We're quarantining him diplomatically by bringing back our Ambassador; economically by cutting off trade. We are quarantining Mr. Castro today
2	0	I found one thing in Governor Bush's answer that we certainly agree on, and that's the low income heating assistance program. this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision-making process on health care
2	0	our values are violently contradicted by the kind of racial profiling that I know exists. I wasn't misleading when I said he was a threat
0	1	it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world. We've got to have a package of reforms
0	1	We believe that there is a new approach. We're taking a brand new approach to eliminate unnecessary regulations, unnecessary bureaucracy
1	1	we ought to be able to shift the trend and begin to move it in the right direction. That will allways be the case
0	1	what he is saying there in effect, we're going to have inflation. I don't believe we ought to pay our bills through inflation, through a phony interest rate
2	0	I'm going to have a top down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom up review. And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality
2	0	If we choose change, it will require us to reach down inside ourselves to find the courage to take a new direction. The future of things that matter to you -- in terms of civil rights, what kind of Justice Department you'll have, whether we'll enforce the law
2	0	I don't have any plan to cut education funding and -- and grants that go to people going to college. I think that anyone that's seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, what about this, what about that?
0	1	We now have 2500 hospices. I've worked all my life when I was in the Congress
0	1	That's what works in other countries. that's what'll work here
2	0	I will have an ethical office in the White House that will be under the President's personal concern. This is a government that is not serving you
0	1	It will require the ability of a Republican president to reach out across the partisan divide and to say to Democrats, let's come together to do what is right for America. It's been my record as Governor of Texas
0	1	this is a president who's gone out and done everything he has said he was going to do. this talk about this -- this weakness. I -- I don't understand what my friend's talking about here
2	0	I think that's wrong. that's pro-family
0	1	I trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives, their destinies and their bodies. I think a woman's right to choose ought to be protected and defended
2	0	so the question here tonight is not where we've been, but where we're going. That we must cut back.
2	0	she knows nothing about the climate. they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do
2	0	One party is ready to move in these programs.. For twenty-five years I served in the Congress under five presidents
2	0	"We're the ones that said, ""Enough."". We need to reform Medicare"
0	1	There's a big difference between the two of us. I will keep us strong
1	1	we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession. we have seen mortgage rates back up again
2	0	We didn't guard 850,000 tons of ammo. They're talking about a tax on utilities, a tax on gasoline and home heating oil -- all sorts of taxes
0	1	people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments. I think that this problem has become so severe, as you know, that we're going to have to do something about home values
0	1	didn't hold public office. At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win
2	0	I'm not just saying this. I think we can do better.
2	0	John McCain and Dick Cheney said when I was saying we would not be greeted as liberators, we would not - this war would take a decade, not a day, not a week, not six months, we would not be out of there quickly. I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining, that we're facing a very hazardous time in the sixties
0	1	we all know that it would've controlled our economy. In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh - expand the private sector
0	1	I’ve proven that I can. for 30 years, I’ve produced results for people
2	0	I've been a practicing Catholic my whole life. we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative cost, bureaucracy, and government regulation that wouldn't be spent in any other nation
0	1	Senator Obama voted against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts on the grounds that they didn't meet his ideological standards. That's not the way we should judge these nominees
1	1	when I proposed my plan this past Tuesday, he or one of his spokesmen called it socialized medicine. I didn't know that the Vice President attacked our program in Massachusetts
1	1	What Senator McCain doesn't mention is he's been there 26 of them. He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington haven't done anything
0	1	A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that. The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people, hopefully, I accept and rejoice in
0	1	3 million jobs lost. There's another part of the lopsided economy that we're in today,
0	1	I haven't heard how his policy is going to be different on Iran than George Bush's. I haven't heard anything yet
0	1	Opposes an amendment to protect the flag of the United States of America. There are some very fundamental differences in this campaign
2	0	I signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources. he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States
0	1	I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions. I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider;
0	1	We've got to have a growing, expanding job base to give us a growing, expanding tax base. we've got to really rebuild our job base
2	0	"the establishment of the 9/11 Commission. The only way they step up is to say, ""Fellas, we're leaving; we've trained you; step up, step up."""
0	1	After that, once again, our Embassy was exploded. We just heard the President's answer for the problems at the barracks in Lebanon, where 241 marines were killed
2	0	we also have important domestic priorities, in education and housing and health care, in economic development, in job training, in the environment. I favor, strongly favor, term limits
2	0	Mr. President, you measure it by whether you're getting the job done. I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break
2	0	The president did not do what was necessary. It's an empty promise
2	0	I remember the floods that swept our state. Sometimes it seems deceptively easy to continue with the old habits even when they're no longer good for us
0	1	I am concerned about ethnic cleansing. I am very concerned about it
2	0	doesn't make sense. they're angry
0	1	we can't just walk away from Pakistan. we're going to have to work with the -- with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they're on
0	1	I've seen at first hand, in a very vivid way, the deep hurt that's come to this country in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia, Chile, and Pakistan, and Angola, and Watergate, CIA revelations. I have uh - an adequate background
0	1	Whenever you do that, inevitably the dictator is encouraged to try it again. first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa
2	0	make a determination of how we can stimulate growth. you can overdo, I'm told, environmental cleaning up
2	0	Libya is now peacefully dismantling its weapons programs. it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy
0	1	you actually owe an apology. you really owe him an apology
1	1	you tried to convince the American people that Bill Clinton is for tort reform. The biggest campaign contributors to your campaign are the trial lawyers of America
2	0	there are opportunities there now. that doesn't mean it wasn't a mistake of judgment to go there and take the focus off of Osama bin Laden
0	1	I'll make the appeal on a wide array of issues. I'll win
0	1	It was the largest stock market correction -- one of the largest in history, which foretold a recession. The stock market was declining six months prior to my arrival
2	0	those are the wrong priorities. We've got to pay it off and build money to renew it- -spend money to renew it
2	0	It's been done before. there's things that government can do.
1	1	providing we have the kind of leadership in Washington that can work with you. I'm more optimistic today than I was when I began about this nation
2	0	Your own secretary of state has said it. I believe the evidence is that our deployments have been successful
2	0	we don't know the details. our nation now needs to speak with one voice during this time
1	1	these islands that we're now talking about are not worth the bones of a single American soldier. Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu
0	1	"The word ""economics"" in Greek came from the word family, or law or custom of the family. you can't have a strong economy without strong communities and strong families"
2	0	It's a nonsensical position that we are in. that's important
2	0	That's going a little bit far. In some cases, they’re murderers, drug lords, drug problems
0	1	I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born. With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, there's one individual who's not being considered at all
2	0	There is a tax loophole right now. They've seen a lot of it during their administration
2	0	We have an adversarial relationship that's destroying jobs and sending them overseas while we have the finest workers in the world. Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on
2	0	over the last ten years that's a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period. I have a plan to do it
0	1	why is it that the wealthiest 1% get their tax cuts the first year, but 95% of seniors have to wait four to five years before they get a single penny?. 95% of all seniors would get no help whatsoever under my opponent's plan for the first four or five years
1	1	Joe Biden opposed that decision. President Donald Trump has put the health of America first
0	1	to make certain that we have adequate uh -strategic forces - adequate conventional forces. we will have to maintain an adequate military capability
0	1	Restore fiscal discipline. we'll do a lot better
0	1	We just had the election there. Peace in Bosnia
2	0	he can't. there's no way that we can build all of the weapons the Vice President says he wants to build within the defense budget
2	0	It's the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list beginning in January of 1989. We are firmly behind preserving our environment
2	0	We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002. You don't help yourself with other nations when you turn away from the global warming treaty, for instance, or when you refuse to deal at length with the United Nations
2	0	he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying we're going to leave it to the states. some of these dictators who hate America and hate what we stand for, with our freedoms, our democracy, our tolerance, our respect for women's rights, those who would try to destroy what we stand for cannot be met with just sitting down on a presidential level as Barack Obama had said he would be willing to do.
0	1	we've had four years of policies being played out. none of it came on federal land
2	0	I am in favor of tax cuts to encourage and give incentives for the quicker development of these new kinds of technologies. That's an essential commitment
0	1	What we have done for the poor is that we in fact - the homeless bill, the McKinney Act, which is the major piece of legislation that deals with homeless - the Congress has cut the funding that the administration has recommended. This administration, and a George Bush administration, will be committed to eradicating poverty
0	1	This one tax would actually tax about 53 percent of small-business income. It's expected to cost us 710,000 jobs
2	0	We have had less man-hours lost by strikes in these last seven years than we had in the previous seven years, by a great deal. That's my difference with the President
2	0	I have made recommendations on that and I have discussed them previously and I will spell them out further in the campaign. They are not changing their mind
2	0	we've got to fight for it. I'm surprised to hear him talk about records
2	0	we have the new program which was submitted at the Bogota Conference - this new program that President Eisenhower submitted, approved by the last Congress - for five hundred million dollars. when I had quoted a Democratic President, as the President says, I was a Democrat
2	0	; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be. I misspoke when I said a CIA head in Nicaragua
2	0	I have said again and again and again let's get off mud wrestling. I speak with some confidence of our plan
0	1	this wasn’t done by smart people.. This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen.
0	1	All they've got to show for 4 years in U.S.-Soviet relations is one meeting in the last weeks of an administration, and nothing before. This is the kind of leadership that we've had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times
0	1	I was with one company that makes valves and -- and process industries and they said, look, we were -- we were having some valves coming in that -- that were broken and we had to repair them under warranty and we looked them and -- and they had our serial number on them. then we noticed that there was more than one with that same serial number
2	0	we don't believe that we should take away the right of people like Valerie Lakey, who was the young girl who I represented, five years old, severely injured for life, on a defective swimming pool drain cover. That's not wishy- washy
0	1	We don't talk about it. We've raised about $10 million
2	0	he was selected by his party at a key time in history. Everybody remembers that
2	0	the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran, you've been all over the map. and that's an indication I think of some of the support that you had at least until you became the VP pick here
2	0	I believe you can protect the environment and grow the economy. I'll crack down on China
2	0	You don't measure it by a percentage increase. I'm not going to increase taxes
2	0	As Martin Luther King said, we ought to judge people on the content of their character instead of the color of their skin. I think it's clear that we're better off than we were four years ago
0	1	I have absolutely no problem with them speaking up. I feel that they have not only a right but a responsibility to speak up
0	1	so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing. that's the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States
2	0	And there are two very different paths the country can take. I think the matter is settled once and for all
2	0	Mitt Romney proposed these sanctions in 2007. I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis
0	1	Seventy-five percent of the people live in the cities. I don't know of a city in America that doesn't have the kind of problems you're talking about
0	1	Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. We have unbelievable—we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet
1	1	The president takes credit for all these people off welfare. When I became president I used the authority I had in this law to get out from certain federal rules to help states move people to work
2	0	I do think there are flexible ways to solve some of the pressing problems, particularly that affect our children. The American people want this environment protected
0	1	including big oil companies, $4 billion worth. an additional $200 billion that he's going to give to big corporations
0	1	He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time. That is absolutely proved over and over again
2	0	It doesn't uh - make a determination as to how uh - that relationship should be achieved in relationship to our current uhh - diplomatic recognition and obligations to the Taiwanese Government. I also think it's important to be somebody who is willing to make those tough choices
2	0	I understand, as well as, with all due respect, the governor or anybody else, what it's like for those people sitting around that kitchen table. I would not support legislation that is being introduced in Congress to override the Food and Drug Administration decision on RU-486
0	1	Fewer people are dying when they get sick.. We’re doing therapeutics already.
2	0	So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this. Nothing political about this
2	0	stealing our intellectual property; our designs, our patents, our technology. You can decide which of us you think are right
2	0	I think we need to have rating systems that are clear. The neighborhoods are safer 'cause crime is going down
2	0	He says to them about the ‘Poor Boys’, last time we were on stage here.. if that's one of your successes, I wouldn't speak about it too loudly
2	0	I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq. The United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good
0	1	We have demanded that the American people sacrifice. Yes
0	1	The governor of Massachusetts at a governors' conference supported a resolution to delay the cost-of-living adjustment. John, you are right: they use this for political advantage
2	0	I think the governor's instinct is not necessarily bad. I would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where it's appropriate and where it's done carefully and responsibly
2	0	they're not on economic policy. make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels
2	0	There's a relatively stable government there now as there is in Kosovo. I support that
2	0	That's the liberal approach. I assume some of those are because of our trading partners
2	0	"Senator McCain, your commercials have included words like ""disrespectful,"" ""dangerous,"" ""dishonorable,"" ""he lied."". I think we were right to pass the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill"
2	0	We cannot do it any longer. Ortega, the commandante who is head of the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, is an avowed Marxist
0	1	I think I was on the advisory committee. It's an example of how oftentimes we may be associated with organizations all of whose particular positions we don't support
2	0	Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country. There are limits to this nation's ability to finance these weapons systems
0	1	Their policies so far, it seems to me, are pretty sound. I don't have to worry in the near term about the Federal Reserve
2	0	I think the record speaks for itself. my faith plays a lot
2	0	we've never had a president since the War between the States that vetoed more bills. Our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs
1	1	We've been dealing with him. he's been dealing drugs to our kids
2	0	when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal. They like it because it doesn't accomplish what I think really needs to be accomplished
0	1	Russia and its republics are out of control or at best in weak control right now. It's a very unstable situation
2	0	in the process, we're going to be saving over the next 10 years another $800 billion. I'm proud of my choice
0	1	those liberals in that House blocked a new idea to bring jobs into the black communities across the country. it's blocked there
0	1	We need to do a lot more about generating the capacity for power here at home. we ought to be able to shift the trend and begin to move it in the right direction
2	0	He's just not credible. I served for eight years in the United States Senate and served on the Armed Services Committee
1	1	When you cut capital gains, you put people to work.. Paul Tsongas, a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut
0	1	In my own state, we did i. we've had great success at revenue enforcement
0	1	Sanctions are loosened. Our coalition against Saddam is unraveling
0	1	They are permanently sentenced to a lifetime of failure. What we want to do is to change that
2	0	I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way.. You can't do that as president
0	1	How are we going to heat the -- heat the house this winter?. He voted against even providing for what they call LIHEAP, for assistance to people, with oil prices going through the roof in the winter
0	1	I've already made a proposal. I'm for Head Start and moving that up
2	0	that every parent has the opportunity to choose what is best for their child. what I try to do is to support policies that would respect religion and then help parents inculcate those values to their children
2	0	I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere. we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland
2	0	The ayatollah sees that there are 50 percent fewer exports of oil. Those are the kids of things that I'd work on
2	0	that is just absolutely unfair to the vast majority of Americans who pay their taxes and pay them on time. I think I should get some credit for that
0	1	If there comes a time where I cannot practice my religion and do my job properly. I will resign my job
2	0	They delivered what they called malaise.. I know they need leadership that's committed to a democracy and freedom
2	0	Let's get on with talking about something substantive. It doesn't speak to the equality of America
2	0	every defense expert I know, including people in the Pentagon itself, will tell you that given the level of defense spending and the level of defense appropriations which the Congress has now approved and the president has signed, there's no way that you can do all of these things and do them well. it was a tragedy
1	1	we were able to restore some of those terribly, terribly unfair cuts to the poor people of this country. If you take AFDC, if you take food stamps, if you take - oh, go down the line on poor people's programs, those are the programs that suffered considerably under this administration's first budget cuts and those are the ones that in the second part of their part of their term
0	1	We don't have an alternative. I'm going to have to
0	1	a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties and 100,000 police and the assault weapons ban. The American people can make up their mind about whether that's a liberal record or a record that's good for America
0	1	We have a plan to clean up two-thirds of the toxic waste sites in America over the next four years. We have a positive agenda on the environment
2	0	The reason Indochina was preserved was the result of the Geneva Conference which Indochina. the facts simply aren't as stated
0	1	We think it is appropriate to return to the American people. The fact is that the program that we put together we think is very responsible
2	0	It only whets their appetite. My priority is making sure that we get more people hired
2	0	I think that's shocking. They’re not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much.
0	1	I recognized that if you're going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible. I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team
0	1	I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent. I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life
0	1	if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax
2	0	2 former defense secretaries recently issued a report saying that 100,000 or slightly fewer troops would be enough, including President Reagan's former defense secretary, Mr. Carlucci. fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy.
0	1	that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area. I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the Pescadores Island
0	1	He said I want to take it from the rich, raise $150 billion from the rich. To get it, to get $150 billion in new taxes, you got to go down to the guy that's making $36,600
1	1	After setting priorities, I want to give some of your money back. I don't think the surplus is the government's money
2	0	we have to go on and balance this budget while we protect Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment. I campaign among people
1	1	So John McCain's strategy in this war, not just whether or not to go, the actual conduct of the war has been absolutely wrong from the outset. John McCain was lock- step with Dick Cheney at that point how this was going to be easy
0	1	My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care. we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state
2	0	Your own secretary of state has said it. You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership
2	0	polls show that they overwhelmingly want some kind of immigration reform. One thing to blame is these malpractice lawsuits
2	0	Twenty-three million Americans still struggling to find a good job. We are now facing a $120 billion trade deficit in this country.
0	1	I think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans. Part of my tax package which is paid for in my balanced budget plan would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains from people when they sell their homes
2	0	we feel with more receipts and fewer disbursements. It's a geopolitical foe, and I said in the same -- in the same paragraph I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face
2	0	When George Bush came into office, we had surpluses. we also have people sicker
0	1	energy policies that are not working. that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down
2	0	I believe in freedom of choice. This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he'd do
2	0	"understand what this means ""without preconditions. I want to be the best president I can be for every American"
0	1	We want to raise the active-duty forces by 40,000. we would also strengthen this military
0	1	We need more work on value-added processing. Value-added processing is important
0	1	I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether. Those things would help a great deal with the cities
0	1	Let's take all these four years in a row. He came in with a high growth rate, the 1990 budget agreement, which some, you know, didn't like
0	1	they've got to understand that they're facing a very firm and determined United States of America that will defend our interests and that of other countries in the world. I think we can deal with them
0	1	it will slow down the economy. I think we shouldn't do it that quickly
0	1	wouldn't it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake?. Wouldn't it be nice to be perfect?
0	1	We'll never have that world leadership until we are strong at home. we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles
0	1	that is just absolutely unfair to the vast majority of Americans who pay their taxes and pay them on time. I'm going to have to
2	0	His plan is three times larger than President Clinton's proposed plan eight years ago. it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process
2	0	They taught me that this was the greatest country in the world. I will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world
0	1	The average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year. I don't think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better
2	0	I disagree with them, as do many. We haven't adequately funded veterans' care
2	0	America is not temporary; we're forever. we've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they're working for you
2	0	"there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, ""Vladimir Putin, our president. We do need to look at our records"
0	1	Mine are words, and his was action. If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse
0	1	I have moved to work with the American people to help them have the tools to make the most of their own lives. I think I should get some credit for that
1	1	we're going to pay for it. He says he wants to give the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country a five-year $40 billion tax break
2	0	I didn't create this mess. The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor
1	1	I want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare. I can't understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare
0	1	we have to enforce the law in 2 ways. that will be my policy
0	1	I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago. I will sign reasonable tort reform
2	0	It's the most sweeping change in 40 years. Sure
0	1	if we go too far. we risk the peace
2	0	I want to stop it from coming across the border. I think what you can do is look at what they've done and recognize that they're not going to do very much in the future
0	1	This has had some other unfortunate effects. I think that the administration has, in fact, in this area failed in a major responsibility
1	1	you have a selective memory. Cocaine is up 141 percent -- marijuana, cocaine up 166 percent
2	0	I owe my president my judgment and then I owe him loyalty. we have in our economic pack, -- individual retirement accounts where we think it will encourage savings
2	0	Nobody is going to follow somebody who doesn't believe we can succeed and with somebody who says that war where we are is a mistake. I think I'm more in touch with the mainstream of America
2	0	if we have the guts to leave. that's the kind of opinions that you've offered throughout this campaign
0	1	I want to give small business employers a tax credit, 25%, to encourage the providing of health insurance for the employees in small businesses. I want to give a tax credit for the purchase of individual health insurance plans
2	0	It had 26 separate maps they had to sign. I. too, believe in the voluntary military
0	1	I've been tested. I've done the job
2	0	when we don't give them the kind of leadership that spells out what their mission is and let's them know why they're putting their lives at risk. it requires a president who is steadfast and strong and determined
0	1	I think, as we reduce our military forces, we should let people earn military retirement by coming out and working as police officers. we need more police on the street
0	1	she works for me. Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job.
2	0	The Shanghai Communique, does say that the differences between the People's Republic on the one hand and Taiwan on the other shall be settled by peaceful means. We have a divided nation
0	1	You're changing the program from a guaranteed benefit to premium support. You are jeopardizing this program
0	1	Your definition of national strength is to throw money at the Defense Department. There's a big difference between the two of us
2	0	when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we're going to have to grow more. Those things would help a great deal with the cities
2	0	I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to -- with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality. it didn't mean that
2	0	I believe in the sanctity of marriage. not rushed to war without a plan to win the peace
0	1	We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities. We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling
2	0	I said that at that time. That's not how it's going
1	1	even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration. that isn't good enough
0	1	why businesses have gone under. It’s his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part
0	1	"I think if you look at the record from voting for sending the troops then voting against the resources they needed when they got there, then saying I actually voted for the $87 billion before I voted against it, saying in response to a question knowing everything I know now, yes, I would have cast exactly the same vote and then shortly after that saying wrong war, wrong place, wrong time, consistency doesn't come to mind as I consider that record. I can think of a lot of words to describe Senator Kerry's position on Iraq; ""consistent"" is not one of them"
2	0	The stakes could not be higher. we have an adversarial relationship between government and business
1	1	I think we should try to raise the fuel efficiency. one mistake he's made is fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles a gallon will throw many auto workers out of work
2	0	that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds. I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home
2	0	we need to give our democracy back to the American people. we're going to have to make some adjustments
1	1	There will always be problems in this whole world. In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago
0	1	How do we pay for it. You can have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget
0	1	who had conviction. They don't need the vice president or the president to tell them what they saw
2	0	With reference to the busing vote that I cast in 1979. what we do is what the Attorney-General of the United States did under the direction of the President: call in the owners of chain stores and get them to take action
2	0	et me talk about that joke about religion which I found very distasteful. I agree with that
0	1	There's even an Apple store in China that's a counterfeit Apple store, selling counterfeit goods. China's been cheating over the years
2	0	I want the farmers feeding the world. we have fought back for four years to get out of that mess
2	0	I  've supported legislation in the first instance in Congress. One is nuclear proliferation
2	0	I'm getting into focus my agenda for America's renewal. The American people want to keep opening doors.
0	1	We need to do more. I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world
0	1	If you're going to die, you don't have to go through this 10-year cycle that FDA goes through on new drugs. Believe me, people with AIDS are more than willing to take that risk
2	0	An all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century. We  've had eight years of talk but no action
0	1	I would make sure that the uh - Saudis understood this ahead of time so there would be no doubt in their mind. if Saudi Arabia should declare an oil embargo against us, then I would consider that an economic declaration of war
0	1	When President Bush decided we're not going to talk to Iran, we're not going to talk to North Korea, you know what happened. Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000
2	0	the vision of the Constitution. Its growth rate is not what counts
0	1	A guy named Michael runs the school. It is a school full of so-called at-risk children
0	1	We need to be stronger on terrorism. I believe in the Patriot Act
2	0	America's going to have that kind of leadership and continue to promote principles of peace to make a world a safer place and make people in this country more confident that their future is secure. There are new economic realities out there that everyone in this hall and across this country understands that there are going to have to be some choices made
2	0	Senator McCain talks a lot about earmarks. In the court
0	1	you can look it up. that's just a fact
0	1	No longer do we give the image of being on the rise. I would say our prestige is not so high
0	1	It includes oil abroad. Perhaps that oil abroad should be treated differently than the oil here at home
2	0	Our military is second to none in the world. The planes were in the air and our negotiators were talking with the dictator down there. And when that dictator got the news from his spies outside the gate that all these planes were taking off, he said, let's get out of here
2	0	The president's policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour and -- and -- and pursue a strategy of leading from behind. He has promised a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund for young working adults to invest and save on their own
0	1	We can't I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans. spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that
0	1	we are on pace to double our exports. double our exports
1	1	he simply doesn't know what he's talking about. I don't feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject, not only of nuclear controls, but also of general disarmament
0	1	How anyone could think that any sane person would believe you could call back a nuclear missile, I think is as ridiculous as the whole concept has been. which is absolutely false
1	1	It's stuck in the Senate. he put a trial lawyer on the ticket
0	1	you take in so much money. you won't change the law
2	0	we don't want to have military involvement there. That bought Bashar Assad time
0	1	The Ford administration does have a very comprehensive program to help uh - our major metropolitan areas. we will really do a first-class job in helping uh - the communities throughout the country
2	0	oe Biden wants to go back to the economic surrender to China that when we took office, half of our international trade deficit was with China alone.. I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions
0	1	I've been involved these issues for many, many years. the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this
0	1	A great historian, Henry Steele Commager, said that in their lust for victory, neither traditional party is looking beyond November. he went on to cite three issues that their platforms totally ignore: atomic warfare, Presidential Directive 59 notwithstanding
0	1	Under my plan, if you make -- the top -- the wealthy people pay 62% of the taxes today.. Afterwards they pay 64%
0	1	we have met our recruitment targets in each of the services this year. we are ready to meet any contingency that might arise
2	0	we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help. that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you're putting forward because it just doesn't work
2	0	He also said in December of 2003 that anyone who doubts that the world is safer without Saddam Hussein does not have the judgment to be president. I was opposed to the war
1	1	there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the United States. attitudes about Americans have changed
0	1	"I've had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country. I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, ""I've been out of work since May. Can you help me?"""
2	0	They have poor-quality health care. if you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover
0	1	They gave peace a chance. we did
1	1	There will be no unilateral disarmament under my administration. the result was unilateral disarmament
2	0	I don't know what that means. treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax
2	0	The American Hospital Association said it could have closed 700 hospitals. The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully
0	1	that's good and that's helped. We've put a cap on the growth of all that spending
2	0	we now have people from the Middle East, allegedly, coming across the border. my plan for the future is better
2	0	there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more. that's what this country should be doing
0	1	now they've done a beautiful job for Barbara and mine. They saved the life of the president of the United States
2	0	Right now, the credit markets are frozen up. I'm convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands
2	0	I had to make the decision to destroy more life, so do we continue to destroy life. Middle-income people are going to get a tax break
2	0	I want competition and I want to pool the insurance and take care of it that way and have. we heard Donald talking about what he did to women
2	0	we think it's very important to rebuild the U.S. military. He didn't honor the agreement
2	0	We cannot slow up on education. And in that neighborhood, it was filled with women and men, mothers and fathers who taught their children if they believed in themselves, if they were honest, if they worked hard, if they loved their country, they could accomplish anything
2	0	they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa - in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa. The HMOs and the insurance companies support the other bill that's pending, the one that the Republican majority has put forward
2	0	Didn't bring in enough nation. I think the most important thing I've learned from this process is what I now know about John Kerry
1	1	I want the federal government, consistent with local control and new accountability, to make improvement of our schools the number one priority. They can't squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class
2	0	that's what I support. I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did
2	0	They determined it was medically safe for the women who use that drug. I could approach President Eisenhower in maintaining the dignity of the office
0	1	I'm worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions. This is a very important topic and it's a very sensitive topic
2	0	I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned. The difference is we've got a new policy
2	0	it's not only a personal achievement for Geraldine Ferraro - and certainly not only the bond that I feel as I go across this country with women throughout the country. I changed the Justice Department's effort to get a church to pay back a man tithe
0	1	he vetoed it. What we need to do is make certain we try to return people to work
0	1	everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted. let them come to birth
0	1	it would cause great unemployment. I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable
0	1	he'll either have to raise your taxes by $900 billion or go into the Social Security surplus for $900 billion. the surest way to bust this economy is to increase the role and size of the federal budget
0	1	We opened a great opportunity in l972, which has pretty well been frittered - frit- frittered away under Mr. Ford, that ought to be a constant uh - inclination toward - uh - toward friendship. I think we need to continue to be uh - strong and uh - I would certainly uh - pursue the uh - normalization of uh - relationships with the People's Republic of China
0	1	that is of interest to the whole Western World and the industrialized nations. One is the Middle East
0	1	"He looked right into that lens and he said out there in San Francisco, he said, ""I'm gonna raise your taxes."" Well he's had a lot of experience in that and he's sure gonna go ahead and do it. Raise everybody's taxes."
2	0	the president is just trying to scare everybody here with throwing labels around. If you're in your mid-40's under the governor's plan, Social Security will be bankrupt by the time you retire, if he takes it out of the Social Security Trust Fund
2	0	Show the tape.. he's going to make sure that this doesn't add to the deficit and he's going to cut middleclass taxes
2	0	choose your plan. I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax
0	1	Why. Because of paperwork and regulation
2	0	Where there are no failing schools. we also believe that gay and lesbians and gay and lesbian couples, those who have been in long-term relationships, deserve to be treated respectfully, they deserve to have benefits
2	0	that's the kind of clarity of leadership. we're making progress
0	1	including closing the loophole that allows companies to use a subsidiary. John Kerry and I believe we need to strengthen the sanctions on Iraq
2	0	You've got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean. it's all a question of what our priorities are
2	0	I voted for the balanced budget in '93 and '97. when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred, for the president to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake
0	1	I think the president, again, still hasn't shown how he's going to go about it the right way. I can do better
0	1	there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. He won’t ever look you in the eye and say that’s what he wants to do.
0	1	wants to spend time with the members of the Joint Chiefs. this administration has a bad track record in this regard
0	1	They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other. That's the enemy that attacked us
0	1	There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America There are only three left. What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history's on our side
2	0	We have to renegotiate our trade deals. I think this insurance policy is necessary
0	1	While the secretary of state's in one country, there are almost a hundred and fifty others that are wondering what we're gonna do next, what will be the next secret agreement. We don't have a comprehensive understandable foreign policy that deals with world problems or even regional problems
0	1	The meaning of this election is the future and whether we're going to grow and provide the jobs and the opportunities for all Americans and that they need. We shouldn't be dwelling on the past, or even the present
0	1	We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. So that’s why I hope that we will come together in this campaign
1	1	I plead guilty to that. You can look all around and you'll see first-class strong women
0	1	the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks. the Bush administration has come to recognize that it hasn't worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies
2	0	Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI, said the same, but Donald Trump, the commander in chief of the United States of America prefers to take the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of the American intelligence community. We are playing the leadership role
2	0	keep faith with our troops. I do not favor abortion
0	1	DIVAD. I can tell him some I'm against
2	0	will hunt and kill the terrorists wherever they are. You haven't just accepted research, Mr. President
2	0	We have a very consistent policy in the Middle East. that's a problem
2	0	"One of the reasons I was successful as the governor of Texas is because I didn't try to be all things to all people. what you had is you had overwhelming ""deregulation"
2	0	We have to restore trust between communities and the police. He called them coerced and the bribed
0	1	It's my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh - he approves of a $30 billion uh - expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned. I don't know where that money would come from
0	1	he misled the American people in his speech when he said we will plan carefully. I think he has not been candid with the American people
2	0	I don't think so. Some of the military
1	1	He didn't succeed and I signed it and I'm glad I did. He tried to keep it from coming to my desk
2	0	I was in Jerusalem a couple of years ago, actually three years ago, in August of 2001, staying at the King David Hotel.  We left in the morning, headed to the airport to leave, and later in the day I found out that that same day, not far from where we were staying, the Sbarro Pizzeria was hit by a suicide bomber in Jerusalem. Fifteen people were killed. Six children were killed.  What are the Israeli people supposed to do? How can they continue to watch Israeli children killed by suicide bombers, killed by terrorists. the Russians are not using Eastern Europe as their own sphere of influence in occupying mo- most of the countries there
2	0	the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system.. I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians
0	1	Education is how to make sure we've got a workforce that's productive and competitive. the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works
0	1	we're going to cut about 5 percent of the discretionary budget, excluding military. You look at how we get to a balanced budget within eight to 10 years. We do it by getting -- by reducing spending in a whole series of programs
1	1	I don't know why -- I've never understood quite why Mr. Perot was so upset it, because one of the guys he used to have working for him, I believe, had foreign accounts. I don't have a one of them
0	1	which I've supported for years. I'm for Stealth technology, to build a Stealth bomber
2	0	same thing with natural gas. The difficulty now is the president's course is quite limited
1	1	And I will address you as Mr. President. You didn't do that with Mr. with President Bush in 1992
2	0	They talk about family income being up. You see that, their small car division leaving
1	1	I've dealt with many a president, and I don't hesitate for a minute to speak up. I've seen many chief executives come into my office and say they're going over and tell the president of the United States off, they're going to pound the desk, and go into that office and turn to Jello
0	1	this weakened our relationships with Israel a great deal. We in effect tried to make Israel the scapegoat for the problems in the Middle East
1	1	The problem with this version of Niagara Falls is that Senator Dole and Mr. Kemp would put the economy in a barrel and send it over the falls. capital would flow out into the economy
0	1	for the people earning more than $200,000 a year, you're going to see a rollback to the level we were at with Bill Clinton. I'm giving a tax cut to the people earning less than $200,000 a year
0	1	what we're doing is saying that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities uh - where people with talent, black or any other minority, can fully qualify. I'm proud of the record
2	0	some of them that are really good projects, will have -- will have to be eliminated, as well. I think that's a good investment.
0	1	you got a big tax increase. Now all you got that tax cut
2	0	And that's what the track record shows, is a desire to increase taxes, increase spending, a trillion-dollar spending proposal that's on the table. it would even make the economy worse
0	1	I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself. Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I'm for it
1	1	I believe there's fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system. We have restored much of our economy
1	1	The freeze people were wrong. where I differ with my opponent is I am not going to make unilateral cuts in our strategic defend systems or support some freeze when they have superiority
2	0	the world needs a strong America. I'll get him no matter what and I know how to do it
1	1	the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy. secondly to meet the needs of our allies and friends
2	0	A stable government needs to be established. when the president ran for office, he said that he'd put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation -- he'd file a bill in his first year that would reform our -- our immigration system
2	0	look at the mess that we're in. it's adding to cost
1	1	the Kyoto treaty was flawed. had we joined the Kyoto treaty, which I guess he's referring to, it would have cost America a lot of jobs
0	1	what we have been able to do is establish a program that is working, that is putting people back to work. That is an accomplishment
2	0	we ended up the way we did. The world is more dangerous
0	1	as they have in the last three and a half years under the foreign policies of this Administration of Mr. Carter's. We can get into a war by letting events get out of hand
0	1	we've got to really rebuild our job base. That's going to take money for infrastructure and investment to do that
0	1	we went from a deep recession into a depression. the last president of the United States that tried that was Herbert Hoover
2	0	because of all their differences. It will work
0	1	I favor home ownership. I want to see more vouchers
2	0	It is possible to get people to work together and to begin to focus on achieving results. We are at peace
0	1	we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression, as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor Romney's now promoting. the price of gasoline was $1.80, $1.86
2	0	it’s racist. It is only in that way that we can persevere
0	1	it's an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we're going to be. if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you've got to go out on the open market and try to buy it
0	1	with an open Government. the job is a very gratifying one
2	0	You just can't promise something like that just to get elected if you know there's a good chance that circumstances may overtake you. The question, I think, should be enlarged
0	1	there are a lot of procedures that haven't kept up in Medicare with the current times. We need to have a modern system to help seniors
2	0	we have proven, I think very conclusively, that you can reduce the rate of inflation and increase jobs. they are people out there making predictions that it's not going to be the same
1	1	as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today. it's shameful
2	0	That means those cars can be exported. We lost our money
0	1	If you make less than $60,000 a year and you decide to invest $1,000 in a savings account, you'll get a tax credit. Now, the tax relief that I propose is directed specifically at middle-income individuals and families
1	1	that sounds very good, but it's very wrong. So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done
0	1	If it's a failing school, shut it down and reopen it under a new principal with a turnaround team of specialists. We have to make it the number one priority
0	1	he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes. You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes
2	0	This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world. I've made some mistakes
0	1	When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia. Peace in Bosnia
2	0	Being a mom, being one who is very concerned about a son in the war. That's got to be changed
0	1	Americans' workers are the best in the world. the point is that we can fix our economy
2	0	that's just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person that's running against them. I think is a mistake
0	1	The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history
2	0	allow small businesses to pool together so they can share risk and buy insurance at the same discounts big businesses get to do. Those are the kids of things that I'd work on
0	1	we've had tough economic times. free and fair trade is the answer, not protection
2	0	it would not be in the best interests of the United States. we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis
2	0	In Lebanon, this President exercised American power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed. I'm concerned about the deficit
2	0	Let me tell you about a friend of mine named Mitch Philpot from Marietta, Georgia -- not far from here -- who Tipper and I met with his family in Johns Hopkins Hospital. I think the choice should be with human rights
1	1	just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits. It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America
0	1	raising taxes on middle income families the way Bush and Quayle have done. then waiting for it to work
0	1	In fact it makes it less likely for them to come here. you're investing in companies doesn't do that
2	0	The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal. And to give them technology of this kind, I disagree with
2	0	in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws. Bill Clinton's economic plan and his agenda will make matters much, much worse
2	0	He said he was going to lower tax rates. I think that the people of this country can rely upon the fact that I will be a lender
2	0	Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment. the problem, John, with the strategy that's been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf
2	0	Of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, $800 million -- billion of that goes to people making a minimum of $1 million. we're not putting restraints on American exploration, we're encouraging it in every way we can
2	0	I'll do it again. I want new incentives for savings and investment for the young couples who are working hard so they can save and invest on their own on top of Social Security, not at the expense of Social Security, as the governor proposes
0	1	you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done. It's the toughest job on Earth
0	1	I mean in Korea - we had uh - three million five hundred thousand young men uh - in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. That's not the way to end unemployment or to reduce unemployment
0	1	you would seem him as president of the United States being very aggressive in this fight against crime, and having that kind of a successful result. that's one of the reasons I'm delighted and proud to be on the ticket with him
0	1	There is a difference, though, as to what the economy has meant. I think the economy has meant more for the Gore and Clinton folks than the Gore and Clinton folks have meant for the economy
0	1	It hasn't worked out that way. we've got to take some decisive action
0	1	India started from about the same place that China did. I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world
0	1	we've got to create jobs. This isn't the beginning of the end of this crisis
0	1	the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs. You raise taxes and you kill jobs
1	1	not secret meetings in the White House with special interests. if Americans trust me with the presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effort
2	0	because of bad decisions. The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor
2	0	I'd say rather than just yelling at one another, why don't we find out where we're apart. I think in all fairness and equity we have to recognize the problem that South Korea has
2	0	I think that's been proven. He went in
2	0	That's been a consistent policy, one I intend to carry out. I am sure that that will not happen
2	0	have extensive trade with Iran. I can assure you that if I'm elected president we will do so
2	0	we've got 111 million American taxpayers that have benefited from our income tax cuts. we have made proposals and proposals and proposals - sound proposals - on reducing nuclear weapons
0	1	I'm for continued research. I also want strong conventional forces
2	0	my plan is for a phased-in tax cut over a three-year period, tax increase and depreciation allowances for business and industry. I then spoke to him; he said, Gerry, that's not good enough
2	0	that state we controlled spending. Mr. Ford uh - actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non-farm jobs than when he took office
2	0	General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we’re doing in the Middle East. The President in the election year decided I ought to do something, I haven't done anything on drugs
0	1	they feel a sense of purpose, a sense of mission. the soldiers there have a higher rate of re-enlistment than anywhere else in the service
2	0	Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down -- or since we've kept records -- 2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we've had.. We all understand what this country has become
0	1	some may be better off. It's not whether we're better off, it's whether they're better off
1	1	Well, we're going to have plenty of time to talk about trickle down government, which you're for.. then waiting for it to work
0	1	More and more women are being elected. I think it would be a good thing for America if it happened
2	0	One of the biggest problems today is that the countries to our south are so desperately poor that these people who will almost lose their lives if they don't come north, come north despite all the risks. I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs
0	1	I think we will wait, see what they present, take a look at it. we also need to look at some options, whether or not we -- depending on what the options are
0	1	try to get together, get the bill passed and give the people the benefits and not play party politics right now. That's the way I would do it
0	1	We have to restore trust. So we have to do two things, as I said
0	1	we can use this money that we save on these weapons to spend on things that we really need. This makes us stronger
2	0	I vetoed the budget you passed with $30 billion in education cuts. We've already got 20,000 out there
2	0	I've done these things. I'm not going to do it
0	1	when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn’t just that 20 million people got insurance who didn’t have it before. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.
2	0	we can and must move faster. I think the answer uh - as to the kind of person that I would select uh - is obvious
0	1	trade deals that make sure that American workers and American businesses are getting a good deal. we've kept on pushing trade deals
0	1	all- volunteer armed force is not made up of the sons and daughters of the beautiful people. it is inappropriate for us, just because there's a problem somewhere around the world, to take the sons and daughters of working people
0	1	He, himself, has said, and rightly so, that he'll be a strong Vice President. When the Vice President makes a decision, that will be his decision
0	1	maybe it's just our difference in government, the way we view government. We can help
0	1	we need the tax base to pay the debt and pay down the interest on the debt and get our house back in order. the core problem that faces everybody in manufacturing in this country, it's that agreement that's about to be put into practice
0	1	You'll help prevent unwanted children, unwanted pregnancies. I think it's important for the United States, for instance, not to have this rigid ideological restriction on helping families around the world to be able to make a smart decision about family planning
0	1	who have the intellect. I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record
0	1	to have a whole new generation of more efficient, cleaner, energy technology. We have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies
2	0	I never made that statement; never would. I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions
2	0	we don't provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests. let's give credit where credit is due
0	1	if the purpose of the tax code is to raise revenue. We ought to think, as John F. Kennedy did, about lowering the rates. They can't go too low
0	1	if you don't have health insurance, we're essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you're out there trying to get insurance on the individual market. we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold
1	1	you already gave them to the oil companies. here's the problem: If we are giving them to oil companies, then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them
2	0	That's the only way we got him back. to give them the capital to refurbish plant and equipment, research and development, improved technology
2	0	I think we ought to have incentives to do it. I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline
0	1	The ultimate irony would be to have that happen to us. every time they do, we lose some of our economic independence for the future
0	1	They plot. The when I can't tell you
2	0	It's meticulous. the committees to whom you refer with the - the employment that you uh - state, and with the 5 to 5 and a half percent growth rate in our economy, that the uh - projections would be a uh - a $60 billion increase in the amount of money that we'd have to spend in l981 compared to now
0	1	Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws, and that’s what it is.. I don’t want to pay tax.
2	0	It's a question of who they are. because of some of the mistakes that have been made
0	1	because of our leadership, because we didn't listen to the freeze -- the nuclear-freeze group, do you remember -- freeze it, back in the late 70s -- freeze, don't touch it; we're going to lock it in now or else we'll have war. I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home
0	1	we can take on this mission. All of these things we can do as Americans
2	0	I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security,. to build a sense of community so we're all working together
2	0	I think it's a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to.. Values begin at the top, in the White House
0	1	There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they then can use to make money. clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries
0	1	This is an enormous boon for them. what's happened with some of the legislation that's been passed during the president's term, you've seen regulation become excessive, and it's hurt -- it's hurt the economy
2	0	We'll stay on the hunt on Al Qaida. I think the American farmer rightfully will reject
0	1	that's a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama. Senator Obama didn't mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs
0	1	what I'm about to say is unclassified. Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega
2	0	We've got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office. we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system
2	0	if Mr. Carter alleges that His Holiness by signing that has done it, he is totally inaccurate. I uh - agreed to give the interview uh - to Playboy
2	0	I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care. I would follow through on Barack's policies
2	0	Go back to Jimmy Carter, and interest rates were 21%, inflation was 15%. I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader
2	0	he didn’t do it. we have a clear plan to improve our public schools that starts with getting our best teachers into the schools where we need them the most by creating incentives for them to go there
2	0	they were defeated. I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important
2	0	there isn't a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem. To extend it to all the world
2	0	I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us. I think the matter is settled once and for all
0	1	my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives. At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win
0	1	as I did him in the past. I selected him
2	0	I'm the first in my family to graduate from college. Lock your wallet
1	1	I'll get us on track to a balanced budget. The president's path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay
2	0	I think they believe in the Monroe Doctrine. I did criticize the President
0	1	if we had listened to Senator Gore and his crowd, and had supported a nuclear freeze. if you would have supported that attitude
0	1	they're showing up in Iraq for the same reason. they're fighting so vociferously
2	0	If I have anything in politics, it's my word. You're supposed to have a government that comes from you
2	0	I think we're all in this together. I support the right to keep and bear arms
0	1	we got to have a knowledge base. We can't simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing
0	1	I hope we get a chance to talk about it. On drugs, I have repeatedly said drugs are wrong and illegal and can kill you
0	1	delayed sanctions. They're moving faster toward a nuclear weapon
1	1	I would only suggest that while we do not take the credit for it - I would not presume to - that since that committee has been formed the price line has been held very well within the United States. I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland yesterday that that committee had not been particularly effective
0	1	now that the energy prices are high, I guess he's not advocating those big energy taxes right now. I'm not in favor of energy taxes
0	1	if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels. with inspiration and hard work we can achieve great things
0	1	The secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package. it's going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes
2	0	It would still have gone up as much as it has, and the $.50 would be added on top of that. The President gained
0	1	They have humiliated the Holy Father. They have cracked down on the only press organ there, La Prensa, censoring the press something that should concern every American
0	1	They're all nice people, they're just in a bad system. I don't think there are any villains, but, boy, is the system rotten
2	0	today, on the average, the average serviceman is at least 15% - and I happen to think that's a very modest estimate - 15% below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time. We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government
2	0	Pharmaceuticals were using loopholes to keep brand -- brand drugs in place, and generics are much less expensive than brand drugs. as we move to one area of the world from another
0	1	The reason No Child Left Behind was left behind was the money was left behind, we didn't fund it. I don't know any government program that John is supporting, not early education, more money for it
2	0	there wouldn't have been any Nimitz to stand on. this isn't about Governor Bush
2	0	we gave them a chance to restore democracy. it's been rejected
2	0	I don't think that would be smart to do. we have it
0	1	I made the recommendation to the president. The president made the decision
2	0	I see what it does. he tried that in 1985
2	0	We're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports. I voted against that
0	1	everybody knew that those of us who voted against the freezing of COLAs did so, we did so emphatically. That simply isn't true
2	0	I did not say it is.. The president says I've changed my mind
0	1	my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities. I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives
0	1	It is to support the peace process. We have a very consistent policy in the Middle East
0	1	You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators. You were wrong
2	0	We're not making those choices. That makes a big difference
2	0	there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind. the Arabs, the Japanese and folks in this country are going to start buying German treasuries
2	0	I think it can only be that they're anticipating or hope. People aren't looking for more of the same
0	1	I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free. I support that
0	1	the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives. He still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq
0	1	Governor Clinton's philosophy is isolate them. I'm not going to do it
2	0	I don't want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed. he was given a chance to vote, and he voted no
2	0	They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other. please let's learn from history
2	0	if we'd used smart diplomacy. It was a tribute after President Carter's election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99.5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools
2	0	That's what got me into this race, so we could rebuild the American economy. I do not want any more trickle down government
2	0	We have a divided nation. So four years ago I stood on a stage just like this one
0	1	They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance -- your insurance plan until you're 26 years old. if you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover
0	1	I mean every child. to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated
0	1	where we build the strongest alliances. I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did
2	0	it worked. This is a family tax cut
0	1	we've had a chance to became now, contrary to our long-standing beliefs and principles, the arms merchant of the whole world. We've tried to buy success from our enemies
2	0	the list goes on and on and on. I will make the playing field as fair as possible
0	1	it never got passed. I never promoted Fannie Mae
0	1	what you have to do is make sure that CEOs don't benefit from this, because this could end up, in the long run, people making money off of this rescue plan. Barack Obama laid out four basic criteria for any kind of rescue plan here
0	1	That's budget neutral. That's a smart thing to do
2	0	President Obama has not even put a credible plan on the table in any of his four years to deal with this debt crisis. We've been in very close touch with Mr. Mitterrand, Mr. Kohl, and others that have met with the leaders of the Soviet Union
2	0	I believe, number one, it would pose a real problem for a lot of smaller states in the Congress who have enough trouble now making sure their interests are heard. at the end of the war we had pretty well decimated their military
0	1	if I'm President of the United States, when I'm President of the United States, we will stand with Israel. if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily
0	1	We've increased money for ammunition and weapons and pay and homeland security. I'm going to spend what it takes to win the war
0	1	All of our children have gone to both public schools and private schools. private schools play a great role in our society.
2	0	I believe that my plan is better than Senator Dole's ill-advised $550 billion scheme. part of our plan is to make it what they call portable
2	0	Wanda Blackmore I met here from Missouri, the first time she bought drugs with her drug discount card, she paid $1.14, I think it was, for about $10 worth of drugs. You got a lot of women running for office
0	1	I think we should do is something I have been trying to do since I have been president, is every time I do something in a public way. I think we have to change the nature of politics
2	0	the right course for America's government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player. I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor's programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan
2	0	I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion. It gives you the choice
2	0	"Our friends and allies have been saying, Gwen, ""Sit down. Talk. Talk. Talk."". Suburbs are by and large integrated."
0	1	It had nothing to do with us. We were not involved
2	0	what we're doing is saying that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities uh - where people with talent, black or any other minority, can fully qualify. that would make war imminent
1	1	The theocracy controls the security apparatus. it surprises me that Senator McCain doesn't realize that Ahmadinejad does not control the security apparatus in Iran
0	1	he paid $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers. Concern about Iraq specifically focused on the fact that Saddam Hussein had been, for years, listed on the state sponsor of terror
2	0	this enormous national debt, engineered by this administration, is harming these countries in fueling this immigration. The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts
2	0	I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important. the American military has performed brilliantly
1	1	Why can't Landale Shakespeare in Cleveland or Pilar Gonzales in Milwaukee give their children an opportunity to go to a better school.. you can't be for school choice
2	0	they said it was about democracy, and they have done nothing other than solidify their Marxist domination over that country. We need an answer to this problem
0	1	I have a grandson. I don't ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific, or rice paddies and jungles in the in Asia or the muddy battlefields of Europe
0	1	I believe we ought to give seniors more options. I believe we ought to make the system work better
2	0	I was sick of seeing people trapped in a system that was increasingly isolating them and making their kids more vulnerable to get in trouble. I think I have experience that counts
2	0	they started with my campaign in New Hampshire. I wanted us to pay for it
2	0	businesses were providing family leave. You can't tell me that a surplus food distribution of five cents per person and that nearly six million Americans receiving that - is adequate
0	1	gone from 800 jobs a month being lost. We've created five million jobs
0	1	This is serious business. that has very serious ramifications, as the intelligence community knows
2	0	they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine. We hadn't done the work that ought to be done
0	1	Inflation is robbing us. I think he ought to be ashamed of mentioning that statement
2	0	it's time we had that bresh of freth air (sic) -- breath of fresh air coming into our nation's capital and sweep out the old-boy network and the cronyism that's been so much a part of it that I've fought against for all these years. the money goes to them
2	0	that plan includes speeding up the training of the military. I think it's time we get rid of PAC money
0	1	It's much more complex. We absolutely must
1	1	it's bad. as though this was a humorous little incident
0	1	we don't administer it very well. the incentives that are in our current way of doing business, are what are killing us
0	1	none of that will happen anymore. over the next ten years you will see a big increase over the percentage of people that have pension plans, plus a secure Social Security system
2	0	I think, joining with our allies and friends in a league of democracies, that we can effectively abridge their behavior. I understand your frustration and your cynicism
2	0	We need somebody to simplify the code. it's your money
2	0	When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it’s in business and trade, where we’re doing so badly. We are the sole remaining superpower
2	0	stopped the Trident or delayed the Trident submarine. Fritz Mondale and I feel very strongly that if you educate your children that that's an effort and the way that you build up and make a stronger America.
0	1	It should be predicated upon the defense needs, the security needs, the strategic needs of the United States of America. that's how they'll be made under Bob Dole as president
0	1	More money is needed and I spend more money, but step one is to make sure we reform the system to have the system in place that leaves no child behind. one of the things that we have to be careful about in politics is throwing money at a system that has not yet been reformed
0	1	It's fair. They deserve the tax breaks, not the super wealthy who are doing pretty well
0	1	I think it's a disgrace that so far Mr. Ford's administration has blocked the passage of legislation that would've revealed by law every instance of the boycott. it would've prevented the boycott from continuing
0	1	it is high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism. I have no quarrel whatsoever with the things that have been done
0	1	They're untrue. she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue
2	0	We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered. we have to succeed
2	0	Nine out of 10 active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq or have come back from Iraq. I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years
0	1	Thirdly, I don't believe that the government contracts division is operated with vigor. I think that the president operates in a number of different areas
2	0	while you've been carrying out your responsibilities -- most of the people here, you've got a family budget. he talks about cutting the defense budget by five to seven billion dollars
0	1	You can't solve a problem unless you diagnose it. you can't cure unless you know
2	0	Are you working harder to put food on the table, feed your children. exports have significantly increased under my presidency
2	0	This is a body based in The Hague where unaccountable judges and prosecutors can pull our troops or diplomats up for trial. I propose a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all seniors
0	1	following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me. I think the matter is settled once and for all
2	0	88 percent of the people -- the President claims 11 million are already covered. I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place
2	0	we thought he had weapons of mass destruction. We're also going to have to work with the Karzai government
0	1	the cast as a result has gone up. I don't think the American people are getting their money's worth from the majority party that run this Congress
2	0	What are we waiting for. Certainly we care about the people, we care about the children, we care about the tragedy
0	1	to do what is right for the American people. put government back on the side of the American people
2	0	we invested in national security. That's just not right
0	1	the government bureaucracy is uh - just a horrible mess. This doesn't have to be
0	1	There are 200,000 people in California, for example, who have lost their defense related jobs. We can create millions of jobs in these new technologies
0	1	Not only would it threaten Israel. We cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon
0	1	You'll be in a world in which fits into my philosophy. The harder you work, the more you can keep
0	1	In that interview uh - Governor Carter indicated that uh - he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle-income brackets or higher. Governor Carter's answer tonight does not coincide with the answer that he gave in an interview to the Associated Press a week or so ago
2	0	It's all happening in this administration. now we have half-a-trillion-dollar deficit annually
2	0	I would like to point out that when we look at our programs in Latin America, we find that we have appropriated five times as much for Latin America as was appropriated by the previous Administration. I have
2	0	that one doesn't sound good. With regard to the employer sanctions, we must have that
0	1	a President must see it like it is. he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.
0	1	The Department of Energy has a multi-billion-dollar budget in excess of $10 billion. I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than government can
0	1	I stand here as my own man and I want you to see me for who I really am. Tipper and I have been married for 30 years
0	1	I feel very strongly about a lot of things. I feel strongly about education
2	0	We're going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves. racial profiling isn't just an issue at local police forces
0	1	"And that's why Tillerson at Exxon and Mulva at ConocoPhillips, bless their hearts, they're doing what they need to do, as corporate CEOs, but they're not my biggest fans, because what I had to do up there in Alaska was to break up a monopoly up there and say, you know, the people are going to come first and we're going to make sure that we have value given to the people of Alaska with those resources. I had to take on those oil companies and tell them, ""No,"" you know, any of the greed there that has been kind of instrumental, I guess, in their mode of operation, that wasn't going to happen in my state"
0	1	we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns. e deserve answers
0	1	There's no private housing. It is a welfare system that is more like a third-world socialist country than what we would expect from the world's greatest democratic free-enterprise system
0	1	it is appalling to me that with 10 million Americans out work, with the rest working harder for less money than they did 4 years ago, with the loss of 1.4 million manufacturing jobs in our nation, with the health care crisis, a crisis of crime and drugs and AIDS, substandard education, that George Bush would constantly try to level personal attacks at his opponent. this, of course, just reached a new low last week when he resorted to a classic McCarthyite technique of trying to smear Bill Clinton over a trip that he took as a student along with lots of other Rhodes Scholars who were invited to go to Russia
2	0	we've already sanctioned Iran. we ought to stand staunch
2	0	if you have a growing economy. the size of the federal government will go down in a Gore administration
1	1	We've got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers. Overhead is overwhelming
0	1	that is not the facts. you live in your own reality
2	0	including young people who may have dropped out of school. that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world
0	1	as far as strength derived from the unity within our country. it's not just campaign rhetoric
0	1	no discussion of it. This is an issue they've brought up
0	1	We have committed $200 million worth of aid. We're the leading donor in the world to help the suffering people there
0	1	There are two very different issues here. they've got to be dealt with separately
2	0	He had 16 other resolutions and nothing took place. They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched
2	0	What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification. This country uh - changed drastically in 1969
0	1	That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take. And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance
2	0	It would have destroyed the economy of California. Bill Clinton's economic plan and his agenda will make matters much, much worse
2	0	I'm pleased to see, Dick, from the newspapers that you're better off than you were eight years ago, too. I think it's worth a shot
0	1	When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted. That was done purposely
2	0	if they don't do it, we're gonna ask for tougher authority in the hands of the FTC on the false and deceptive advertising. Of course we're worried about Osama bin Laden
2	0	a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11. that has very serious ramifications, as the intelligence community knows
2	0	She's been doing this for 30 years. that's the kind of thinking that our country needs
2	0	He lobbied actively against passage of the Byrd-Warner provision. I don't see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn't inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on
1	1	I didn't raid the pension fund of Massachusetts. took $29 million out of his state pension fund that's equivalent at the federal level of taking out of the Social Security trust fund
0	1	He says he's learned how to match unemployment with inflation. This affects human beings, and - and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration
0	1	if I've done him an injustice, and he didn't say it. I'm very, very sorry
0	1	When he told me this story, he said it wasn't the help, the cash help. He cares about 100 percent of Americans in this country
2	0	The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D. card. In our first debate he indicated that I had not had experience or at least uh - had not participated significantly in the making of the decisions
2	0	Wanda Blackmore I met here from Missouri, the first time she bought drugs with her drug discount card, she paid $1.14, I think it was, for about $10 worth of drugs. They opposed the creation of a Department of Homeland Security, and then they were for it
0	1	just as I had an education after World War II with the GI bill of Rights. I want to help young people have an education
2	0	I am not wrong. The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there
1	1	I think you know that these last four years haven't been so good as the president just described. we're going to get it done in a second term
0	1	it will drive the system into bankruptcy unless we reform and deal with it. They seriously question whether or not there will be any system left for them
0	1	they can get more money. the Arabs, the Japanese and folks in this country are going to start buying German treasuries
2	0	I was not aware that it was -- that they're in epidemic there, because we have made progress in terms of the overall rate of AIDS infection, and I think primarily through a combination of education and public awareness as well as the development, as a result of research, of drugs that allow people to live longer lives even though they are infected. we passed it in the United States Senate
2	0	If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons -- and the President's proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldn't have any argument. I can't tell how proud I am of her and her family
2	0	Like Kyoto Treaty would have done. You were wrong
2	0	You must understand the region. Young people are looking to us
1	1	I think is terrifying. He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them
0	1	It is going to require a new spirit. There is a huge difference of opinion. Mine is I want to empower people in their own lives
2	0	parts of the FBI couldn't talk to each other. Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford
2	0	the greed and excess and the cronyism in Washington, D.C. If I become president, I'll get America working again
0	1	I believe it's essential that we do it. here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas
1	1	I'm proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done. of course we had a Democratic Congress and they didn't want to do that
0	1	Then his budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund. It would have charged seniors more for out-of-pocket costs as well as more in premiums
2	0	There ought to be filters in public libraries and filters in public schools. it is a violation of international law
0	1	If we're going to talk about trips that we've taken -- when I was a candidate for office, first trip I took was to visit our troops. when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors
2	0	for example, if, heaven forbid, one of them were to pass away, they have trouble even arranging the funeral. I don't think he should say that our prestige is at an all-time low
2	0	This is a Main Street tax cut, 15 percent across -- let's take a family making $30,000 a year, that's $1261. I look back at the vote on Medicare in 1965, we had a program called Eldercare that also provided drugs and means tests to people who needed medical attention received it
0	1	That requires a cool hand at the tiller. it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation
0	1	The average working person can't - uh - can't take advantage of that, but the - the wealthier people - uh can. Another one that's uh - that's very important is the uh - is the business deductions, uh - jet airplanes, uh - first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch
0	1	then, of course, the President ran out to California and announced, well, maybe we'll have another B-1or B-2 Bomber. the mixed message, the ambiguities of U.S. foreign policy, uh are -- I believe, and Bob Dole believes, is causing not only problems for this country throughout the world, but particularly here at home
0	1	We believe that taxes should not be increased on those families. We have a plan to cut taxes on middle income families within a balanced budget plan, eliminating the deficit and protecting Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment
0	1	that's not enough. it's time we take a look at the pay scales
2	0	I supported a big increase in the safe and drug-free schools program. We've got to invest and grow
0	1	She's given money back to the taxpayers. She's a reformer
0	1	The infrastructure is there to be able to deliver that product to market. there are places where we think we ought to go forward and develop those resources
2	0	If you're going to die, you don't have to go through this 10-year cycle that FDA goes through on new drugs. That's budget neutral
1	1	I cannot see where a $.50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline. I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline
0	1	in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded
0	1	Israel is our strongest and best ally in the Middle East. We have got to assure them that we will never allow a second Holocaust
2	0	"It's not labels. My opponent at one time said, ""Well, get me elected, I'll have them out of there in six months."""
1	1	Just before he joined Senator Dole on the ticket, he said that the plan -- the part of the plan that raises taxes on 9 million of the hardest working families in America was unconscionable, that means it's wrong and it shouldn't happen. Bob Dole and Jack Kemp are not only going to cut the tax rates across the board and lower the Capital Gain Tax
0	1	The only involvement I've had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs. We were not involved
2	0	I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate. we can fight this war
0	1	He has already weighed in and helped stabilize some of the difficulties in the markets and with companies and corporations, institutions today. A supporter of Senator Obama's is Warren Buffett
2	0	Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives. That is my passion
2	0	"we've never had a president since the War between the States that vetoed more bills. he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges - that only judges that hold a certain, quote, ""view,"" on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government"
2	0	those teachers can make a difference. I don't think that's what America is all about.
0	1	They look down on people who are a different color.. we’re all Americans
2	0	If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things. I believe that we used our skill
0	1	this administration has no credibility on this issue. They're moving faster toward a nuclear weapon
0	1	I know what the challenges are. And, thank God, I know what the joys are, too, of living in America
0	1	He knows to learn from the mistakes and blunders we have seen in the war in Iraq, especially. but, again, John McCain who knows how to win a war
1	1	Over a 10-year period. even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don't add up
0	1	I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we're able to get the people back to work. I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security
0	1	today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product.. They start from a much lower base.
0	1	They cannot even buy medicine. When we talk about cutting health care costs, let's start with the insurance companies and the people that are making a killing instead of making our people healthy
0	1	In the last two years, I have made policy decisions involving - long-range difficulties and policies and made day-to-day judgments not only as president of the United States but as the leader of the free world What is the result of that leadership?. America is respected
2	0	We want peace. which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated
0	1	When George Bush came into office, we had surpluses. now we have half-a-trillion-dollar deficit annually
0	1	China's been cheating over the years. We will have to have people play on a fair basis
0	1	Sometimes we cannot let other countries have a veto on our foreign policy. Sometimes the United States has to act alone or at least has to act first
2	0	I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be allowed to protect themselves and their families. that's where the mission went wrong
2	0	At his pace, it's going to take 13 years to reduce and get ahold of all the loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union. we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation
2	0	I agree that the surplus is the American people's money. I've made some decisions on Israel that's unpopular
2	0	There's differences. despite the politics of it, I stand where I stand
2	0	the FDA took 12 years. when he states that we're second in education
2	0	there's a lot of good people working hard. I believe on this great moral issue he should speak out and give his views clearly
0	1	a research and development tax credit. I want to give people permanent incentives on investment tax credit
2	0	counterfeiting our products, selling them around the world, even to the United States. You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day
2	0	I don't think it's enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I haven't sorted it out. I think whoever's in the White House should just make it absolutely unconscionable and inexcusable
0	1	we didn't. I believe the president broke faith with the American people in the way that he took this nation to war
2	0	we've already implemented 17 percent of them. I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record
2	0	They see us saying when we come into the administration, when they're sworn in, we need more space with our ally, Israel. I think that's the wrong thing
2	0	I remember when Ronald Reagan was the president. we're more respected
1	1	that's not a flip-flop. the president's been very busy running around the country using what I just described to you as a reason to say I'm wishy-washy, that I'm a flip-flopper
2	0	He didn't do that. it's not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out - the woman working in some factory being taxed too little. It is that we are continuing to spend too much.
0	1	giving our people a better chance to understand and control their government. This is the kind of change that would be made
2	0	I believe there's fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system. they better not tell the parents of those young marines
0	1	he rates for a general practitioner have gone from $40,000 a year to $100,000 a year for an insurance policy. We think this has a devastating impact on the quality of health care
2	0	I made it clear that I don't have any further political aspirations myself. we're not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street
2	0	it isn't the label that he wears or that I wear that counts. We ought to do that, then we can have a commission
2	0	We stand for those values. I have released all of my tax returns
1	1	when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot. I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses
2	0	We didn't cut Medicare. I think he has not been candid with the American people
0	1	"why not do what I have offered to do and asked the Soviet Union to do? Say, ""Look, here's what we can do. We'll even give it to you. Now, will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid, all of us, of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat?''. I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon"
2	0	they don't play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency. I feel strongly about education
2	0	"I don't want to see ""under God"" come out from our currency. not vetoing family planning legislation the way George Bush has consistently done"
0	1	That we must share in an ever-increasing scarcity.. That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary.
0	1	the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this. They're moving very rapidly
0	1	I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961. to take a chance uh - now be - and not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapons, I think would be a great mistake
1	1	I say the programs and the leadership that failed then is not the program and the leadership that America needs now. He offers retreads of programs that failed
0	1	In precinct politics in Texas and I've seen it at the national leve. We have made the Social Security Trust Fund sound
0	1	who are here just because they're trying to figure out how to feed their families. if we're going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers, people who are hurting the community
1	1	I guess the thing that I'd want is a commitment that pretty soon they're going to do something about making this a safer world for all of us. we are not doing anything to stop the arms race
0	1	what does matter is a plan. What means something is: Do you have a plan?
2	0	I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely. this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face
2	0	not supported by the majority of people throughout the country. For example, as I have said, we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months
2	0	Governor Clinton says $200,000 but he also says he wants to raise $150 billion. It has been an abject failure, this administration's policy
2	0	there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life. the result is interest costs that have never been seen before in terms of real charges
0	1	Our family does. I have a deep religious faith
2	0	our foreign policy in the last few years, uh - the American people, the Congress have been excluded. We need to make it very clear—whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else—the United States has much greater capacity
2	0	If I had it to recommend all over again, I would recommend exactly the same course of action. We're one of the first states that said you can sue an HMO for denying you proper coverage
2	0	"I won't be talking about it to the press or I won't be knifing him in the back by leaking to make me look good and complicate the problems of the president of the United States. Some say, ""well, you're a little old fashioned."" Maybe I am"
0	1	we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the -- in the -- in our state in that case. as president, I will sit on day one -- actually, the day after I get elected -- I'll sit down with leaders -- the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue -- as we did in my state
0	1	we must be committed to trying - to clean up the water, clean up the air, and do everything we can, not only from a research standpoint, but also in the applied legislation to see that that's carried out. I'll do those things that are necessary to put the environment of our country number one
2	0	It’s just going to be talk. It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country
0	1	I think the vice president knows it. that pledge isn't realistic
0	1	he promised America that he was going to build this coalition. It is not the kind of coalition we were described when we were talking about voting for this
0	1	I would not agree to any negotiations or any agreement that involved conduct on the part of the Soviet Union that we couldn't verify every day. Every system that is verifiable should be placed on the table for negotiations for an agreement
1	1	Where we're not making the progress, Sander, is in we're making it in teenagers. I do believe that there's some fairly good news out there
0	1	In February he said we had the best economy in Â 30 years, just February. I get attacked so many times on these questions
2	0	They're getting less money. I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life.
0	1	Your doctor chooses your prescription. No HMO or insurance company can take those choices away from you
2	0	make sure that we're investing in the American people. Bill Clinton's economic plan and his agenda will make matters much, much worse
0	1	something we haven't had over the course of the past many years. that's something I want to lead
2	0	As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned - the one for medical care for the aged - that that would be financed out of Social Security.. I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself
2	0	if we're at a point in history where we want to stop talking about it and do it. I think in terms of the recession, of course you feel it when you're president of the US
2	0	He made a mistake in invading Iraq. Dr. Kissinger did not say that he would approve of face-to- face meetings between the president of the United States and the president -- and Ahmadinejad
2	0	I think that the president has to be prepared to use the power of the nation when our vital interests are threatened. If you look at our opponent's tax proposal, they discriminate between stay-at-home moms with children that they take care of themselves and those who go to work or who, in fact, have their kids taken care of outside the home
2	0	North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability. when I became president we'll not only be strong in those areas but also in defense - a defense capability second to none
0	1	unfortunately that's sometimes where those steps lead. not if it goes closer and closer towards redefining the traditional definition of marriage between one man and one woman
2	0	this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people. the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason
2	0	if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made,. we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system
2	0	They discussed the possibility of a small training unit or having a total takeover of the training in Iraq. I'm not gonna exclude the American people from that process in the future
2	0	it's not $650. Now, the tax relief that I propose is directed specifically at middle-income individuals and families
2	0	if he had had his way when the Nimitz was being planned, he would have been deep in the water out there. I got a better plan
2	0	I don't think he was misleading when he said that it was right to disarm Iraq in the spring of 2003. I'm not questioning his patriotism
0	1	now we spend more than any other nation in the world -- 199 billion a year -- and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of education achievement. This is a government that is not serving you
2	0	U.S. reliance on Arab oil as a percentage of total imports is much higher today than it was during the 1973 Arab oil embargo. we have got to increase the standards
0	1	everything’s down. Here’s the problem
2	0	If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws. they certainly are a little nervous when Senator Obama says, if you don't get the health care policy that I think you should have, then you're going to get fined
2	0	I want to see peace. that's what is going to happen
0	1	I support equal rights but not special rights for people. I don't think they ought to have special rights
0	1	My own background is different from his. I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress
1	1	They made the recommendation first. Who answers to a civilian leader
2	0	our nation stands alone right now in the world in terms of power. if I have the privilege of being your president for another four years, I promise you I will always listen to your voices
0	1	part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence. I'm trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally
2	0	Al Gore and I have felt for a long time, first as parents and then only second as public officials. he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior
2	0	I am running for President as an Independent. I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken
2	0	It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. I think troubles a lot of people in our country is that the president has just sort of described one kind of mistake
2	0	I think he's arrived at a very dangerous judgment in the question of war and peace and it concerns me very much. which we don’t have now
0	1	I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to -- with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality. I propose $2 billion worth
1	1	I think those are the wrong priorities. his tax cut plan, for example, raises the question of whether it's the right choice for the country
0	1	Last year there were twenty-nine. tomorrow when the preliminary vote is held you will see a strengthening of that position or very closely to it
0	1	This administration, by going into the Star Wars system, is going to add a dangerous new escalation. Every system that is verifiable should be placed on the table for negotiations for an agreement
0	1	not only to ensure that we can identify the illegal aliens. With regard to the employer sanctions, we must have that
0	1	That's encouragement. And the American workforce is the greatest in this world, with the ingenuity and the work ethic that is just entrenched in our workforce
2	0	they're the ones that, with the encouragement of Senator Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington. Your responsibility is to show up on November the 5th
0	1	the president say that young people ought to be able to take money out of Social Security and put it in their own accounts. that's an invitation to disaster
2	0	This has got to be stopped. you can't blame that on anybody
2	0	we want to bring him to justice. my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase
0	1	we're working on three or four other areas now. that's what our trade ambassador our commerce secretary and all the other people in our administration are trying to do
1	1	It's gotten a little nasty. I think the man anybody that gets into this political arena and has to face you guys everyday deserves a word of praise
2	0	more foreign fighters are spilling into this country. I think when you look at those results, you know the plan I've laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if you'll give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st Century
0	1	I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost. Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so
1	1	I know suburbs so much better than you.. He wouldn’t know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn.
2	0	I will get us on track to a balanced budget. I believe that the cruise missiles which we are now developing in research and development across the spectrum from air, from the sea, or from the land, uh - can be uh - included within a SALT II agreement
2	0	we passed a trade bill that has this premise, that any country that has full access to our markets, we're entitled to full access to their markets. we're cutting investments in research and science that will create the next Apple, create the next new innovation that will sell products around the world, we will lose that race
1	1	Mr. Ford, unfortunately, has just made a statement that's not true. Mr. Carter has indicated he would look with sympathy to a Communist government in NATO
0	1	Discrimination ought to be punished. No discrimination
2	0	you're paying for that. you really have to pay attention to words
0	1	if you want to keep doing business and selling your products over here, you're going to have to quit pirating our CDs. they agreed to do things and verify that they had done it, which will make the problem much better
2	0	there has to be an interlocutor you can trust and deal with. our foreign policy in the last few years, uh - the American people, the Congress have been excluded
2	0	"understand what this means ""without preconditions. we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative cost, bureaucracy, and government regulation that wouldn't be spent in any other nation"
0	1	I vote against them. I have fought time after time against these pork barrel
0	1	in what direction it ought to go. do we want this country to go that far left
1	1	the first thing that Bill Clinton and I are going to do is to raise $150 billion in new taxes. I talked with them.
0	1	We've got ten and a half million new jobs. The American people can make up their mind about whether that's a liberal record or a record that's good for America
2	0	those people love this country and they're patriotic. I'm not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.
0	1	There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill. there were things added in in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill
2	0	I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side. I'd rather be able to just line it right out of there and get on about passing some good stuff but leave out the garbage
2	0	African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities. Our coalition against Saddam is unraveling
0	1	if you were the governor of a state that was dead last in health care for families, and all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in its history, wouldn't you want to maybe use some of it to climb from 50th to, say, 45 or 40 or something or maybe better?. I would
0	1	we have stood on the side of democracy. across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries
0	1	They would not have materialized for about nine to eighteen months. In addition, the jobs would not be available right now
2	0	when the president announced the surge, you'll remember, Martha, he said the surge will be out by the end of the summer. it's not time to divorce
0	1	if we are on the mount. they'll be persuaded to follow our example
2	0	everything you’ve heard just now from Donald is not true. That qualifies you for being president of the US.
2	0	I took a state that was one of the poorest states in the country and had been for 153 years. we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally - a strong ally of the United States
2	0	Of course we're going to have to make some determination on this. we've become a third world country
2	0	we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession. there's no way that we can build all of the weapons the Vice President says he wants to build within the defense budget
2	0	I found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package. he would wait until after the election to do it
0	1	Colin Powell, our secretary of state, announced one day that we were going to continue the dialog of working with the North Koreans. I think, is one of the most serious, sort of, reversals or mixed messages that you could possibly send
0	1	we know from all the studies that the youngsters learn, kids learn more in the first few years of life than any where else. I want to work for universal free school
2	0	telling the patient, you need a more expensive test. tax cuts for the middle-class
0	1	they've hurt kids all over this country. These programs have been cut and slashed and butchered
2	0	I do think there are special experiences and judgments and backgrounds and understandings that women bring to this process. It's Manpower Services
1	1	I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past. I know he wants to disown it
2	0	we invested in national security. pay for it out of a federal fund
2	0	I voted against it. for a while he was a strong supporter of getting rid of Saddam Hussein
0	1	We created 23 million new jobs. We went from deficit to surplus
2	0	it's instructive. there’s a lot of fear—in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect
1	1	I don't want to go down the path to Spain. We're now spending 42 percent of our economy on government
0	1	It's a strategy that we've been working on for a couple of years. now we've got a very good concept called competitive strategies
0	1	And John McCain has been the consummate maverick in the Senate over all these years. That's what I've done as governor
1	1	I don’t know who said that.. That’s what this is all about.
0	1	This is about, somebody said earlier, one of the first questions, we're together. I'm looking at our economic plan
2	0	hopefully tonight we're seeing the final results of that bold and brave effort. those are very disturbing to the American people
0	1	we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world. in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy
2	0	We would have had sanctions. anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error
2	0	There is no such proposal. That's not the case
0	1	The president blocked it. He did block it
0	1	that's where a majority of Americans live, in urban areas. they're facing a financial and social crisis
1	1	Now doggone it, let's look ahead and tell Americans what we have to plan to do for them in the future. Say it ain't so, Joe, there you go again pointing backwards again
0	1	There is a difference of opinion. It's a difference of opinion
2	0	they're matters of very deep conviction, as far as many, many people in this country believe. People listening out there know the benefits of the tax cuts we passed
0	1	My definition of national strength is to make certain that a dollar spent buys us a dollar's worth of defense. There's a big difference between the two of us
1	1	the enemy attacked us. I would hope I never have to
2	0	"it wasn't $200 billion. if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, ""Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America"
2	0	They want to know that their president and their vice president will keep them safe. We believe in supporting, without jeopardizing the security of Israel in any way
0	1	we've seen a rapid expansion of our commitments around the world as troops have been sent hither and yon. I think that the administration has, in fact, in this area failed in a major responsibility
0	1	We pick people who are open-minded. We picked two people
1	1	The plan from Senator Dole and Mr. Kemp is a risky, $550-billion tax scheme that actually raises taxes on 9 million of the hardest pressed working families. we need to lower the tax rate across the board on working and saving and investing
2	0	They see, when we say that these options are on the table, the secretary of defense walked them back. We want to reform the Medicare system to make certain the benefits are there for our senior citizens
0	1	we should be that. We are the sole remaining superpower
0	1	it's not a new position for me. like John McCain, I have learned from experience
2	0	The federal government has been reduced in size by more than 300,000 people. the counterinsurgency principles could work in Afghanistan
2	0	It's time for a change. I expect to win
2	0	We now want to extend it to PTA meetings and scheduled doctors appointments. George Bush, who I think is one of the finest Vice Presidents this country has ever had -- George Bush and I have crisscrossed the country, and we've had, in these last few months, a wonderful experience
2	0	you can't blame that on anybody. They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched
0	1	the government doesn't create jobs. Federal government doesn't do that
2	0	It's not a matter of diplomacy or trade with me.. I think the important thing in picking a vice president probably varies from president to president
2	0	We passed it out of the House of Representatives. we can do better than the past administration has done
2	0	the great recession hit. if we continue with these policies, this trillion and a half dollars worth of new debt that's already been added on the backs of the American taxpayer is going to increase even more
0	1	we need to put enterprise zone into, in, America and need to lower the rates of taxation on labor, capital and the factors of production. That'll happen under Bob Dole
0	1	if the Chinese Communists attack the Pescadores and Formosa, they know that it will mean a war. I would not ho- hand over these islands under any point of gun
2	0	They know what it's like not to have family leave or childcare. I want to spend 14 percent more and give that 6 percent back to the people
2	0	Secondly, he would issue a challenge, and the challenge would be in the nature of temporary, mutual, verifiable, moratoria to halt testing in the air, in the atmosphere, that would respond with a challenge from the Soviet Union, we hope, to sit down and negotiate a treaty. There has been reference to expensive spare parts, hammers costing $500.
2	0	One of the best in advancing all kinds of benefits for children to grow up healthy and strong. the - the final thing is that I have signed and approved of more scenic rivers, more wilderness areas, since I've been president than any other president in the history of the United States
0	1	I visited Poland, Yugoslavia and Rumania to make certain that the people of those countries understood that the president of the United States and the people of the United are dedicated to their independence, their autonomy and their freedom. I don't believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union
0	1	you cannot change positions in this war on terror if you expect to win. He changes positions
0	1	those of us who want to be your President should tell you now what we're going to do. We've got to deal with this problem
2	0	I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate. I believe that there is a fundamental difference
0	1	we have to start making some decisions. We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate
0	1	I've thought a lot about what it means to be the president. I also understand that an administration is not one person
0	1	One party is ready to move in these programs.. I think it shows the difference between the two parties.
1	1	He has no respect for our president. She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people
0	1	the black businesses that employ so many people. There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up
2	0	we're going to have to get some love in this country between races, and between rich and poor. we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers
2	0	The electric decontrol bill that I fought for and signed in Texas has mandatory emission standards. The president likes to say he has a plan
2	0	We should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer. which John McCain voted against both of them
2	0	when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas. The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor
0	1	that liberal Democrat grain embargo that knocked the markets right out from under us and made Mr. Gorbachev say to me when I was here, how do I know you're reliable suppliers. In the first place, never go back to that Democratic grain embargo
0	1	in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy. My plan has not only a short-term component, but also a long-term component
2	0	So deregulation was the promise. when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it’s a one-sided transaction where we’re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we’ve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.
1	1	John McCain has been dead wrong. John McCain said there would be enough oil to pay for this
2	0	Iran is gonna get eighty F-14s before we even meet our own Air Force orders for F-l4s. We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax
2	0	a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point. There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six-year period
2	0	The middle class needs relief, tax relief. Look at the Republicans that have endorsed me
1	1	That's not the main issue. I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman's life or to act if her health is severely at risk
2	0	A lot of them are mentally sick. we have to know what our values are and who we're fighting for and what our priorities are
2	0	That's social engineering. that is they want a stable world
0	1	we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months. we have eighty-eight million people working in America today - the most in the history of the country
0	1	Before the surge occurred -- so you be a little straight with me here, too -- before the surge occurred, we said they'll be out by the end of the summer. Nothing political about this
0	1	Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him. This is how Donald thinks
2	0	We've seen the African-American unemployment rate go below double digits for the first time in 25 years and it stayed below for 25 months in a row. He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington haven't done anything
1	1	tell the truth. I don't care whether he demonstrated or didn't demonstrate
2	0	in doing the things that the United States has done, not always well. His whole deal is you've gotta be for it or against it, you can't make it better
2	0	I don't think we agree on that. I'm worried about our country
2	0	I want high wage, high skill jobs. let me start with Texas
0	1	we've been involved with Iran. I fully understand the threat
0	1	It's not being taken away from anybody else, except we'll downsize the Department of Education. this is a very liberal administration
2	0	This is an issue that will require a new attitude. What I would not have had done was left 10,000 troops in Iraq that would tie us down
2	0	We need to do more than that. I think is a mistake
2	0	88 percent of the people -- the President claims 11 million are already covered. their economy is lousy
0	1	All seniors will be covered. I'm going to work with Democrats and Republicans to reform the system
0	1	In the last four years, there have been twice as many bankruptcies as new jobs created. I think the American people deserve better than they're getting
0	1	I don't support censorship. I think we need to have rating systems that are clear
0	1	A woman came to me and she said, look, I can't afford insurance for myself or my son. it's expensive
2	0	before we made a bluffing statement. So good
0	1	not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing in sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies. every time you've offered an opinion, you've been wrong
2	0	more people qualify for them. they have the opportunity to move students out of poorly performing schools to good schools
0	1	And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up.. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together
2	0	You see all these ads. we're going to build the strongest international network to prevent nuclear proliferation
0	1	Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court - and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges - I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia. in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of - for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit
0	1	For a return to traditions and values that we once had. I don't think there's any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which we've abandoned so much in this country
0	1	American people deserve to know Senator Kamala Harris was one of only 10 members of the Senate to vote against the USMCA.. It was a huge win for American farmers, especially dairy in the upper Midwest.
0	1	Go back to Jimmy Carter, and interest rates were 21%, inflation was 15%. The misery index -- unemployment and inflation added together -- it was invented by the Democrats -- went right through the roof
0	1	that state we controlled spending. We cut the rate of increase in spending in half
0	1	I bring down the tax rates. lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs
2	0	We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and we've told you where the money is coming from. They're very strong
2	0	can't afford. You don't have to have the government mandate that for that to occur
1	1	We consume 25 percent of the oil in the world. John McCain has voted 20 times in the last decade-and-a-half against funding alternative energy sources, clean energy sources, wind, solar, biofuels
0	1	My average in two years is twenty-six. the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes
2	0	He did support deregulation almost across the board. we are able to now speak to the American public and address the issues in a way such as this
2	0	We’re not going to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants, we’re gonna build. . .. I think we're going to have to do better
2	0	the Kerry record on taxes is one basically of voting for a large number of tax increases -- 98 times in the United States Senate. A lot of good people have lost jobs
2	0	Bill Clinton and I want to get our country moving forward again. in addition, we had a very - some very good news in the reduction in the rate of inflation
0	1	they were flooding both parties with crooked PAC money. Nobody touched that tar baby till the day after election in 1988
0	1	I disclosed absolutely everything. I led the fight for disclosure
2	0	They're banning automobiles some days of the week. You have to see it to believe it
2	0	Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal help to education. The two budgets the congressman introduced have eviscerated all the things that the middle class cares about
0	1	They had built covert facilities. With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb
0	1	If you make bad investments, that's too bad. The governor's plan is Social Security minus
2	0	it's not working. Governor Carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs
0	1	It hurts the farmers. We shouldn't be using food
2	0	it permits the president to sort out the priorities. give more power back to the states and back to the people back to the taxpayers
1	1	That's not how you bring people together. He called them coerced and the bribed
0	1	We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago
0	1	we've been focused on Iraq. They are -- the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence
0	1	I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun. I think is a mistake
0	1	I would have put them in place earlier. It's absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions
2	0	which I believe we can, if we go out and buy up these bad loans, so that people can have a new mortgage at the new value of their home. We should be helping them build schools to compete for those hearts and minds of the people in the region
0	1	we finally passed the Kassebaum bill. They're going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president
2	0	so the question here tonight is not where we've been, but where we're going. I'm intrigued when I hear Vice-President Bush talk about his support of the president's economic program and how everything is just going so beautifully
1	1	I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake. a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down
1	1	The amount of money being spent to try to mislead the American people is demagoguery. he would wait until after the election to do it
0	1	We heard Senator Kerry say the other night that there ought to be some kind of global test before U.S. troops are deployed preemptively to protect the United States. It's a consistent pattern over time of always being on the wrong side of defense issues
2	0	If you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up. the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same path
2	0	This is a question of organizing the housing community. We have considered inflation in our figures
0	1	The misery index -- unemployment and inflation added together -- it was invented by the Democrats -- went right through the roof. We've cut it in half
0	1	Iran is gonna get eighty F-14s before we even meet our own Air Force orders for F-l4s. the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy
2	0	We threw out that old CETA that didn't train people for jobs that existed, simply rammed them onto the government payroll. This is the kind of change that would be made
2	0	it requires a complete understanding that we not only chase down Al Qaida but we disrupt terrorist safe havens as well as people who could provide the terrorists with support. Your responsibility is to show up on November the 5th
2	0	which is mobile and thus less vulnerable. we would have a fight between Sunnis and Shias
2	0	That was the reason Congress gave him the authority to use force. We want justices who will interpret the Constitution, not legislate it
2	0	I've had to make thousands of decisions since I've been President, serving in the Oval Office. Senator McCain talks a lot about drilling
2	0	They're not going to follow an American president who says follow me into a mistake. I thought it was in our strategic interests to keep Milosevic in check
2	0	as well as the values of service my family gave me, into public life. .But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are—she doesn’t know if it’s the Russians doing the hacking
2	0	He says we have to move from one area of the world to another.. We have worked hard for peace and freedom
2	0	personal income is down. there are a lot of procedures that haven't kept up in Medicare with the current times
2	0	You’re going to have plans that are so good. providing we have the kind of leadership in Washington that can work with you
0	1	The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone. trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies
0	1	we learn by our mistakes. it will never be repeated
0	1	you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start. I think I've had that
0	1	I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people
0	1	It's in a part of the world where they're not going to see whatever would come from that war. It's a different country
2	0	If he'd let the inspectors do their job and go on. that's why he wants to veto it, just like he vetoed an earlier bill this year
0	1	that's just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person that's running against them. I will do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past
0	1	in the meantime, we'll have a plan to help poor seniors and in the meantime it could be one year or two years. I'm going to work with Democrats and Republicans to reform the system
2	0	it's going to take discipline of the executive branch. He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war
2	0	the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program. we began a new dialogue with North Korea, one that included not only the United States, but now China
0	1	I am very oriented toward the future. I think this election has to be geared toward the future
0	1	I mean, those are not the kind of things that John Kerry and I believe in. we also believe that gay and lesbians and gay and lesbian couples, those who have been in long-term relationships, deserve to be treated respectfully, they deserve to have benefits
2	0	I think there's been too much said about religion and politics.. It's not driven by politics
2	0	We passed tax relief. Small business--you've got to have capital
2	0	I traveled to these places. I don't believe that we need to do what you've suggested here
2	0	the largest tax increase in the history of the world. we have a very robust set of plans
2	0	I think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to. In our international trade, as I said in my op- opening statement, we have become the arms merchant of the world
2	0	We knew we had to act for the middle class. you really owe him an apology
0	1	They paid us back, and we got a dividend in the process. The United States of America shouldn't be blamed for the management of Mexico's monetary policy
0	1	Strength requires knowledge, command. I object to the covert action in Nicaragua
2	0	the president will not secure the loose material in the Soviet Union -- former Soviet Union for 13 years. over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq
0	1	"Then he called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she was Latina. one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest"
0	1	in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency, uh now it's permanent, it's enormous, it's growing every day. We have seen uh - the Federal Energy Agency established, for instance
0	1	not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israel's right to exist and recognizes UN Resolution 242 as a basis for Middle East peace. These are a few of the things to which our nation is committed
0	1	We've gone from first to twelfth in the world in wages. the national debt is not the only cause of that
2	0	we ought to find out whether he's committed to democracy. We also have tax incentives for investment in job-creating activities
2	0	It's not just about the differential with respect to women. if you made less than $10,000 with all the budget cuts that came down the line, you suffered a loss of $400
2	0	the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited. I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world
0	1	not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. it is important that we learn about what has been effective
0	1	any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace that's good for both sides. it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place
2	0	What happens in South Africa, where, for example, the Nobel Prize winner, 2 days ago, said this administration is seen as working with the oppressive government of South Africa. no president of the United States, in my opinion, should signal in advance to a prospective enemy, what his uhh - decision might be or what option he might exercise
2	0	These uh - kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in - in reducing uh unemployment. They were with the drug companies
2	0	I wish that Senator Quayle would change his mind on that particular piece of legislation and give us the kind of a campaign reform law that I think is needed in America. I will make sure that we invest in our country and our families
1	1	Your choice is nothing. Some schools aren't even safe
1	1	I like the way we did it in Massachusetts. What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote
0	1	With Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al Qaida. this is a region in tumult
0	1	We're spending reconstruction money. That's the plan for victory
2	0	Has an 11 year old son and can't let that son compete in sports and Little League. we think it's very important to rebuild the U.S. military
2	0	In other words, we're going to take Joe's money, give it to Senator Obama, and let him spread the wealth around. that's happening
2	0	Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work. That's wrong
2	0	we've become weaker in each of those four.... we also then finally had to stand up democracies in their stead afterwards
2	0	to invest in the human mind and science again, so we're out front. we're matching them up
1	1	Bob Dole and I want to cut the tax rates across the board on each and every American, working, saving, investing and taking risks in America. The plan from Senator Dole and Mr. Kemp is a risky, $550-billion tax scheme that actually raises taxes on 9 million of the hardest pressed working families
0	1	the relations between Russia and China. I think the next president of the United States should watch it carefully
2	0	Immediately before the Kansas City convention, he added back another one point eight billion dollars in the defense budget. We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate
2	0	We talk about it all the time. I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that
2	0	I want to do the same thing. when I became president we'll not only be strong in those areas but also in defense - a defense capability second to none
2	0	the Taliban -- what we've found out, and we -- you saw it in Iraq, Martha, unless you set a timeline, Baghdad, in the case of Iraq, and -- and Kabul, in the case of Afghanistan will not step up. When a drug comes in from Canada, I want to make sure it cures you and doesn't kill you
2	0	We have cut inflation by better than half. I wish the Soviet Union had continued them
0	1	We had the finest military in the world on the ground. the right thing to do
2	0	We need to have as well a strong military. John Kerry has been absolutely clear and consistent from the beginning that we must stay focused on the people who attacked us
0	1	We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because it's so dangerous. we need law and order in our country
0	1	The inclination that Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he has been running for President - I think since 1968 - to inject American military forces in places like North Korea. The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations
2	0	also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity. There's too much wrangling
0	1	and they're good. I've developed -- put out money in my budget to expand community health centers all around the country
2	0	Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them. I think this is a great country
2	0	They would know all about our problems. I think it is a deterrent
2	0	when we know that something has to be done that is in the national interest. This race is about values
0	1	They will find a state. the reason that it's a problem to go shopping state by state
0	1	I don't disagree with that. Absolutely not
0	1	They also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years. it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well
0	1	It's coming back now, so they can buy even more American products. I think it will go down more
2	0	I'm spending my money -- not PAC money, not foreign money, my money -- to take this message to the people. in those respects, we're not strong
0	1	I think they ought to pay with their life. I favor the death penalty
1	1	Every time in this century we've lowered the tax rates across-the-board on employment, on saving, investment, and risk-taking in this economy, revenues went up, not down. We have a balanced budget plan that protects the defense budget, also Medicare, Medicaid, education, the environment, and give tax -- gives tax cuts to middle-income families
0	1	if we just stick out heads in the sand and pretend that it's not real. we're not doing ourselves a favor
0	1	I think we have far too many abortions in this country. My objective and the president's objective is to try to reduce abortions in this country
0	1	it's an idea that the president has been pushing. enterprise zones are important
0	1	I think we can do that in a way that represents what America is all about. I'll have an administration that will make you proud
2	0	In Africa, the United States has ignored Latin uh - Africa. People are going back to work; 6 million of them.
0	1	John, I'm a man that's been a chief executive for ten years. I've picked cabinets
0	1	How much longer will it take, Dan, for trickle down economics to work, in your theory?. then waiting for it to work
0	1	it's been hurting for a long time. the auto industry is hurting
2	0	We've done it in Arkansas. All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith
0	1	I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way. I favor closing the gun show loophole
2	0	I understand it pretty well. I do not think we're doing enough
2	0	"I know a lot about that. The mistake that was made was making the ""read my lips"" promise in the first place just to get elected"
0	1	We can not just run the clock out on the 20th Century. that is not good enough for this country
0	1	We ought to move forward swiftly on my ideas of ethanol which would use more corn, and therefore, create a bigger market for our agricultural products. I believe the answer to the agricultural economy is not to get the government further involved, but to do what I'm suggesting
2	0	that's important to this country. It is not jobs versus our environment
2	0	they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000. I don't believe it is
1	1	John Kerry and I will always fight for the American people. They were with the drug companies
2	0	it's such an assault on their humanity and their citizenship. We are the authors, the Democratic Party, of Clean Air, of Clean Water, of the superfund
1	1	This is not research. we're going to
2	0	We're seeing rural hospitals close all over the country because of this kind of an administration. I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership
0	1	I did a lot of work on this. At the rate that the president is currently securing it, it'll take 13 years to get it
0	1	we can't simply drill our way out of the problem. What we're going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology
0	1	I was afraid that they couldn't make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference. I voted against that
2	0	I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to. many of the programs that I'm talking about - economic growth, care for the aged, development of our natural resources - build the strength of the United States
0	1	he doesn't tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits. Here's the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you're getting from your employer
2	0	I think the American people understand it hasn't worked. I do strongly support the WIC program
2	0	the air would be cleaner than it is if you pass the Clear Skies act. they have done very well
0	1	he's still going to try to be actively involved. unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in Serbian politics
2	0	these are the policies I want to bring to the White House. something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions
0	1	best equipped it has ever been. There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six-year period
2	0	I think you ought to consider doing something about it, and voting for an Independent in 1980. I don't see how you can lead this country to succeed in Iraq if you say wrong war, wrong time, wrong place
2	0	Those folks on the sidelines knew that two months ago. I believe that you can take that position and not be pro- abortion, but you have to afford people their constitutional rights
2	0	they're choking to death on the air pollution. The trillion comes from the surplus
2	0	The treaty does not include these two islands. we were committed to success in Iraq
0	1	One-third of our public schools are failing under this administration. we have a clear plan to improve our public schools that starts with getting our best teachers into the schools where we need them the most by creating incentives for them to go there
0	1	You're talking about Roger Revelle. His family wrote a lengthy letter saying how terribly he had been misquoted and had his remarks taken completely out of context just before he died
0	1	"we said, ""Why not cut out the middleman?"". as a consequence, what we've been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans"
2	0	the initiatives that we took in southern Africa are the best examples of what this administration is doing and will continue to do in the next four years. We were especially disturbed, Joe, at a recent fundraiser you attended where there was a comedian that got up and criticized George Bush's religion
1	1	we're going to give you other choices to choose if you want to do so, just like they do the federal employees. In the Medicare reform I talk about it says if you are a senior, you can stay in Medicare if you like it
0	1	earlier we heard about the auto industry and the timber industry. There have been 250,000 jobs lost in the automobile industry during the Reagan-Bush-Quayle years
0	1	Fifty-four percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed as individuals. when you bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more people
0	1	put a cloud on the total commitment that our people feel toward the Israelis. There ought to be a clear, unequivocal commitment without change to Israel
0	1	more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth. This nation is the most religious nation on Earth
0	1	I have committed it to public service since I was 29 years of age. what have I - going to do with my life
2	0	Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance. They haven't said what's going to happen
0	1	The idea he doesn't realize that Article I of the Constitution defines the role of the vice president of the United States, that's the Executive Branch. Vice President Cheney has been the most dangerous vice president we've had probably in American history
0	1	The effort that we've mounted with respect to Iraq focused specifically on the possibility that this was the most likely nexus between the terrorists and weapons of mass destruction. What we did in Iraq was exactly the right thing to do
2	0	All of the loans have been paid back. Let's give them a real choice
2	0	Under my plan, they get $1800 of tax relief. We have one of the most advanced patient's bill of rights
2	0	Through our Race to the Top program, we've worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms. I think we can save money through this whole very sophisticated concept
2	0	there were clerics there. Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life
2	0	every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace. The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice
0	1	This doesn't mean that the people aren't going to be paying the bill. he suggests that as far as his medical care program is concerned that that really isn't a problem because it's from Social Security
0	1	everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it. He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns
0	1	We aren't going to lay back and let them roll over our economy. show the big oil companies and the OPEC oil-producing countries that we  've got some resources with which we can fight back
2	0	If there's more time for gridlock and talk and finger pointing, I'm the wrong man. there is a record here
2	0	it's important to the fight on terror. You'll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage
0	1	I went to Washington to fix problems. in 2006 seniors are going to get prescription drug coverage for the first time in Medicare
0	1	in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth. It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country
2	0	the President of the United States, the highest office in the world, the most important office in the world, has a responsibility to young people, as we talked about earlier. their economy is lousy
2	0	Iâ€™ve supported the President on Bosnia. he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior
2	0	What we're talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent. You should know as much as possible about each of us
2	0	I sat for as long as they had questions on the issue. It's completely out of control
2	0	Bonus plans to keep some of our high-skilled folks in the services and a commander in chief who clearly sets the mission. Under my leadership we're going to win this war in Iraq
2	0	A lot of them are mentally sick. unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq
0	1	it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here. there has been an increase in poverty
2	0	Mr. President, you're batting 0 for 2.. I don't feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject, not only of nuclear controls, but also of general disarmament
2	0	I will pay down the national debt. If you want to participate in some of the dynamic changes that are going on in our country, you will get specific help in doing that
2	0	the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons. I support it and the Pescadores Island
1	1	ridiculing a person's name is a little beneath this process. he took a tremendous pounding and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding
2	0	I agree with your idea that we've got to help homeowners. There are some things I don't understand
0	1	We should recognize that this country lives in such a way as to build an alliance with our free enterprise system that can build a better America for our children and our grandchildren. it's got to take new leadership in Washington
0	1	In the last four years, you cut permits and licenses on federal land and federal waters in half. that's not what you've done in the last four years
2	0	I think he made a mistake. I wanted the American people to know I was willing to give up something
0	1	He worked really hard. I have a different experience
0	1	And there is a connection. I think that really frustrates people is that so often political campaigns seem to be more about the politicians that are running than the people
2	0	I'm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. We don't feel that you're in any way hurting anybody else by reaching out with affirmative action to help those who've been disenfranchised
2	0	I don't think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh - select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision. what you're seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism
2	0	Defense medicine defined as testing and treatment that is only necessary in case of a law suit. At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win
0	1	Senator McCain mentioned looking at our records. We do need to look at our records
0	1	We need to. that's the way Eisenhower and Reagan and Kennedy and others did it
0	1	I think that the way to grow this economy is to keep taxes low. the fundamental question of this campaign is: Who's going to keep the economy growing so people can work?
0	1	that needs to be done. that will be top of an agenda item, also, under a McCain-Palin administration
0	1	the opposition is being armed. We should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer
0	1	There are limits to this nation's ability to finance these weapons systems. there are limits to what we can spend
2	0	I advocate pardon. we were supporting a dictator, Musharraf, had given him $10 billion over seven years, and he had suspended civil liberties
0	1	we can collaborate with them. we can be a partner with China
0	1	I would take eh - the strongest possible measures short of uh - actual military uh - action there by our own troops. I would never uh - go to war or become militarily involved, in the internal affairs of another country unless our own security was direc- rectly threatened
2	0	I don't buy planes. I think that's shocking
0	1	We're not going to support the $300 billion tax cut that they have for corporate America and the very wealthy. we are going to, in fact, eliminate those wasteful spending that exist in the budget right now
0	1	We're going to make it affordable and accessible. I have a plan to cover all Americans
0	1	I would propose, and I proposed it way back in March when I was a candidate in my own state of Illinois, I proposed $11.3 billion, specifically, in cuts in the Federal budget. fiscal restraint, I think is necessary
2	0	You call yourself the King of Debt. don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1
2	0	I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices. We don't have refinery capacity
2	0	This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons. That was the wrong judgment, and it's been costly to us
0	1	Companies will come. It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch
2	0	we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military. I think it's going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile
2	0	I served in Vietnam. I'm going to change that
0	1	we're going to do better. we'll do better still
2	0	They do not need it. That's exactly what we're doing
2	0	I don't know what that means. there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world
1	1	that's not true. Vice President Quayle said they're important, but George Bush eliminated them from his urban plan
0	1	I was the leader of the underground of the American pilots who were shot down in prison in North Vietnam. I look back on those years as the beginning of wisdom, learning everything a man can learn about the vulnerabilities and the strengths that are ours as Americans
0	1	followups, wherever we find suggestions that they're violating it. subject to full verification
0	1	I think that holding onto the old ways and the old argument that the environment and the economy are in conflict is really outdated. I will fight for a clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy
2	0	He hasn't had a tough cross-examination-type press conference in over thirty days. John McCain's maverick position that he's in, that's really prompt up to and indicated by the supporters that he has
2	0	I wanted to give Clinton the power to use force if necessary. Over time we have developed a government that comes at the people, that comes from the top down
1	1	replace it with a doctrine of prevention and cooperation. And a policy that would reject the Bush Doctrine of preemption and regime change
2	0	I see an involvement by a thousand points of light. a little bit of naivete there
0	1	if you extrapolated how much money we're talking about. you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent
2	0	and when the evidence was there, we indicted him. I voted the way I voted because I saw that he had the policy wrong and I wanted accountability
2	0	That’s never happened before in America.. They haven't put a credible solution on the table
2	0	We have an environmental crisis. I think it’s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is
0	1	He sees the currency going into the tank. Let me tell you what the ayatollah sees
0	1	I made some tough decisions. I understand everybody in this country doesn't agree with the decisions I've made
0	1	Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit
1	1	He feels that we're moving ahead. I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined
2	0	This is what the families of MIAs want.. I'm not going to go to entitlements as a means for cutting that deficit when we're spending billions on something like Star Wars, when we're spending billions on other weapon systems which apparently the Vice President wants to keep in his back pocket or some place
2	0	that's the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America. the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion.
0	1	I'm a guy who wants to help with the experience I have, the American people. I think the president's campaign has tried to characterize me as -- as someone who's very different than who I am
2	0	We understand that balancing the budget, keeping America out of debt is a way to keep interest rates down and the economy growing. This is something I take seriously
2	0	I have fought to cut spending. We didn't have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops
0	1	a program in the case of equal job opportunities, and one that would also deal with our older citizens. In analyzing the figures we will find that our unemployment exists among the older citizens
1	1	Those are two hypo-rhetorical questions. How do you deter nuclear attack without modernizing our nuclear forces when the Soviets are modernizing and how come you spend-willing to spend a dime on something that you consider a fantasy and a fraud.
0	1	What the Congress said was it was a model. Less than four-tenths of 1 percent waste or fraud in the program
2	0	in his press conference in Havana in 1955, he praised the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- Batista dictatorship - that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand Cubans in seven years. That's what the war on terror is about
0	1	"you cannot use ""talk tough"" during the course of a 90-minute debate in a presidential campaign to obscure a 30-year record in the United States Senate. There isn't"
0	1	he's afraid he's going to get hurt and he won't be able to provide health insurance to pay those bills. My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care
0	1	that secrecy has surrounded the decisions made by the Ford administration. Mr. Ford exclude himself from access to the public
2	0	oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap. I don't think this issue should be politicized
0	1	he can't tell the truth. You cannot lead this great country of ours by misleading the people
2	0	has won the support of a great many people all over the state. that is not the facts
0	1	I'm a plain-speaking man and I learned long ago that your word was your bond. I promise you tonight that I'll try to address your concerns and not try to exploit them
2	0	He's been the head of the Committee on Government Contracts that's carried out two cases, both in the District of Columbia. I did
2	0	it is unfortunate. I will keep Social Security in a lockbox and that pays down the national debt
0	1	they called it the full faith and credit of the United States. When FDR established Social Security, they didn't call them IOUs
0	1	"to at the same time put a prescription drug benefit on the credit card, a trillion-dollar tax cut for the very wealthy. they talk about this Great Recession if it fell out of the sky, like, ""Oh, my goodness, where did it come from?"""
2	0	Ladies and gentleman, he gave you a speech and told you he'd plan carefully. We're going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible
0	1	Spring, summer, fall. The calendar works the same every year
0	1	nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia. this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face
2	0	We have the best health care delivery system in the world and we want to keep it that way. That's what President Clinton did
0	1	"They did it. the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to the President, said, ""Don't put those troops there.''"
0	1	We've almost doubled it. It's now over $10 trillion
2	0	Name one group that supports you.. It's not in our national interest to use force in this case
2	0	if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. there is no connection between them
0	1	I will not raise taxes. I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze
2	0	He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after I'd been talking about it for months. The Ford administration does have a very comprehensive program to help uh - our major metropolitan areas
0	1	if need be to keep the peace. I think it's important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East
0	1	The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective? How do we get schools to be more competitive?. Let's grade them
0	1	you know it's difficult. I think fair-minded people that really understand international terror know that it's very hard to guard against
0	1	I’m going to make the corporate tax 28%.. I’m going to eliminate a significant number of the taxes.
0	1	I've spent my entire life in the service of this nation and putting my country first. I've asked you not only to examine my record, but my proposals for the future of this country
0	1	we still have a long way to go. that doesn't mean that we don't have a long way to go
2	0	Do you know that we've laid a $10 trillion debt on these young Americans who are here with us tonight, $500 billion of it we owe to China. This plan has been endorsed by every major — every major environmental group and every labor group
2	0	We think of civil rights as something like crime in your neighborhoods.. I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesn't cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year
0	1	He says that he voted for the resolution. He says he supports the President's position
0	1	With respect to Iran, the British, French, and Germans were the ones who initiated an effort without the United States, regrettably, to begin to try to move to curb the nuclear possibilities in Iran. I believe we could have done better
2	0	They don't have that kind of equity in Social Security today. I think I did a much better job
1	1	that's what my plan does. Governor Romney's plan doesn't do it
2	0	they also know if they live in San Diego, Mr. President, if you're caught with 125 pounds of marijuana or less, you go back to Mexico. Mitt Romney's a good man
2	0	More, more carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that’s emitted in the United States.. It hurts communities
1	1	This is not punitive. John wants to add $300 million, billion in new tax cuts per year for corporate America and the very wealthy while giving virtually nothing to the middle class
0	1	we have to do so making absolutely certain that we know who we are helping. I am confident that Assad's days are numbered
2	0	My own background is different from his. the mantle of leadership for the -- promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America
0	1	that actually works sometimes. Putting ideas on the table, working with Democrats
0	1	I've had to deal with those crises as best I could. I've seen the strength of my nation, and I've seen the crises it approached in a tentative way
2	0	n the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts.. I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and some worries on the part of many leaders across the globe
2	0	There wouldn't be time for a President to decide. Even in cases of rape and incest, their platform requires that a woman be penalized, that she not be allowed to make a choice, if she believes, in consultation with her family, her doctor, and others, whoever she chooses, that she wants to have an abortion after rape, or incest
2	0	isn't it a paradox that we have the highest productivity in our workforce in the industrialized world and at the same time have the largest trade deficit, and at the same time rank behind 9 other nations in what we pay our most productive people in the world, and we're losing whole industries overseas. we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow
0	1	as we did in 1983 between Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill. We're going to have to sit down across the table, Republican and Democrat
0	1	The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred. It's incredibly hard
0	1	give people like you and our families the power to give those values to our children. I supported giving parents a V-chip on their television so if they don't want their young kids to watch things they shouldn't watch, they wouldn't have to
2	0	We had the finest military in the world on the ground. it helps the environment
0	1	And then I went down to the border towns of Storok (ph), which had experienced missiles raining dowm from Hamas. I saw families there who showed me there where missiles had come down near their children's bedrooms
0	1	I've submitted, what, 4 different budgets to the US Congress in great detail. a plan that I believe really will help stimulate the growth of this economy
0	1	five times as large geographically. It's a different country
2	0	the law that was proposed in Texas that had the support of the Byrd family and a whole lot of people in Texas did, in fact, die in committee. We can't keep spending and borrowing like this
0	1	number is to grow the economy. mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit
2	0	until we're strong here, until we're moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful. I don't think we should have that kind of a program
0	1	it's being used in an effort to divide this country on an issue that we should not be dividing America on. It's nothing but a political tool
2	0	The road to war is always paved with good intentions. the United States' economic recovery from the recession of a year ago is well ahead of the economic recovery of any major free industrial nation in the world today
0	1	we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally - a strong ally of the United States. I believe that it's in our interest and in the interest of Israel and Iran, and Saudi Arabia, for the United States to sell arms to those countries
2	0	a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past. I believe we can all work together to make the individuals in the future have more and all of us working together can build a better America
0	1	It will cause the six-party talks to evaporate. I can't tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea
2	0	because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn’t say it. I think it's time you take a stand
2	0	holding down the value of their currency. All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith
2	0	it's lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter. He is very passionate
2	0	Try and get a mortgage these days. we've got to get it right in the education system
0	1	t is particularly terrible to take poor tiny little children and wait until the first grade and bus them across town to Mars, where the children know their numbers, know their letters, have had every advantage. You've got to have world class teachers, world class books
2	0	They'll plan. I do not think that they are
2	0	if the purpose of the tax code is to raise revenue. We ought to think, as John F. Kennedy did, about lowering the rates. we care about our people in Texas
2	0	In the state of Massachusetts he has the homicide rate down to the lowest of any industrial state. I notice that his task force that is working for his future plans had some of their ideas revealed in The Wall Street Journal this week
0	1	"Vice President Gore repeated it about ten times in St. Petersburg. I'm a little offended by this word ""scheme"
0	1	the changes are mind-boggling for world peace. I think we've dramatically changed the world
2	0	we began a new dialogue with North Korea, one that included not only the United States, but now China. “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on
0	1	Yes, it does. We need to do more
2	0	by keeping our country at peace. that will change
2	0	He'll say all these things to try and scare people. we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing
0	1	So we're distributing in our State of Texas for free. I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free
2	0	when you're vice president and you have to fill in like I did the night of the crisis in the Philippines. This is primarily an ideological battle
2	0	the world would have been a lot worse off. we use diplomacy every chance we get, believe me
2	0	go forward as fast as we can. Government always needs the money it gets
2	0	I understand this is a difficult issue. It's about getting 12 million jobs, higher take-home pay, getting people out of poverty into the middle class
0	1	as a consequence, what we've been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans. our priorities make a difference
2	0	After that, once again, our Embassy was exploded. We are going to start the engine rolling again
0	1	You've got every rich Middle Eastern country over there trying to buy nuclear weapons. that will lead to another five star migraine headache down the road
0	1	They don't reform it and don't save it. With respect to Al Gore and Joe's plan, they don't reform Social Security
0	1	Jonas Salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had. I can think of doctors and scientists
0	1	We continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas. we still continue to open up new areas for drilling
2	0	I made commitments to 2 things -- more jobs and better schools. it's just a welfare program for the rich
0	1	I have relatives on Medicare. I'm trying to save your Medicare
0	1	For years kids were allowed to pray in schools. We don't think that's a merger of church and stare to have nonmandatory voluntary, nongovernment-ordered prayer.
2	0	they haven't done it. I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest
2	0	After five years, he finally sent a high-ranking diplomat to meet with the highest-ranking diplomats in Iran, in Europe, to try to work out an arrangement. We've got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses and American workers
0	1	there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress. The difficulty now is the president's course is quite limited
0	1	If you pay taxes, you are going to get a benefit. Of course it does
2	0	It's now the largest peacetime government ever in terms of the take from the total economy. The president wants to keep them open
0	1	which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers. I will label China a currency manipulator
2	0	we don't believe that we should take away the right of people like Valerie Lakey, who was the young girl who I represented, five years old, severely injured for life, on a defective swimming pool drain cover. Let's give low income parents the same right that people of power and prestige have in America
2	0	It was very clear, the Russian intentions towards Georgia. the senator, whose boss is going to get it half way balanced in 4 years
2	0	what we are talking about are problems that are facing the entire nation. this economy strong again
2	0	The president's put it in place as much public debt -- almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined. I'm proud of what we did at the Democratic Convention
2	0	We have huge difference between us on this question. We went out and built housing
2	0	it wasn't me that turned it down, the Soviet Union disavowed it. We have been successful in Portugal
0	1	We've run up more debt in the last eight years than under all the presidents from George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined. What he's proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in the Federal debt in the course of the past eight years, an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years, is a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country
2	0	It's a culture that somewhere along the line we've begun to disrespect life. I believe we have a responsibility to care for one another
2	0	The mountain passes fill in with snow. we're going to get the great entrepreneurial spirit of this country
0	1	You don't think it's right to prohibit a kid from praying in schools. For years kids were allowed to pray in schools
0	1	Bill Clinton tried the approach that I'm talking about. We created 23 million new jobs
2	0	if we have a good balanced approach. Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I'm for it
2	0	Go look at them. we can do a better job of homeland security.
0	1	he said he's going to have a novel health care plan. The federal government is going to run it
0	1	He's been able to do that with an educated program for the people of that state by adding some 1,500 new police officers. In the state of Massachusetts he has the homicide rate down to the lowest of any industrial state
2	0	I also thought the wealthiest people in America ought to pay for it. It's good for small businesses, good for owners
0	1	Donald, she has a name. one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest
2	0	I spent my life in the private sector, not in government. I want to put money in your pocket
0	1	we offered first to get rid of all those - we tried to reduce the SS-18's and those weapons. we said if that's not good enough, there is flexibility, let's talk about the bombers and planes
0	1	The United States of America shouldn't be blamed for the management of Mexico's monetary policy. I fail to understand the basis of the charge that we caused the monetary crisis in Mexico
0	1	He also was opposed to mandatory drug sentencing for drug dealers in the state of Massachusetts. He is opposed to the death penalty for drug kingpins
2	0	I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. I certainly would not impose any litmus test
2	0	then when you go to Japan, where we're spending 6-1/2 percent on defense of the democracies, they're spending one percent. They're going to have to make the decision themselves
2	0	I used to sign welfare checks for my grandparents. Al Gore and I will continue to do that
2	0	if you uh - take the medium or middle-income taxpayer - that's about $14 thousand per person - uh - Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country. you probably detected my frustration with their attitude about the American people
0	1	That's money in your pocket. If you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit
2	0	I am not wrong. Very serious mistakes in judgment were made
0	1	When you total up all the federal spending he wants to do, it's the largest increase in federal spending in years. there's just not going to be enough money
0	1	I have a history of getting things done in the United States Senate. So every major decision he'll be making, I'll be sitting in the room to give him my best advice
2	0	improving our education system. I think a woman's right to choose ought to be protected and defended
2	0	Then companies won't come here. Wonderful new legislation that's helping blacks more and more.
2	0	If that's the case, we really don't have a difference. the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nation's security
1	1	As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be. In my opinion, the government is not effective in -- in bringing down the cost of almost anything
2	0	It's time to do it because we have run up so much debt that time is no longer our friend. It hasn't worked
0	1	I think the Communists have been moving with vigor - Laos, Africa, Cuba - all around the world today they're on the move. I think we have to revita1ize our society
2	0	they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000. it's an abomination
2	0	everyone is struggling to make sure that they can afford their premiums and that they can have affordable and available health care. I think we shouldn't do it that quickly
0	1	People have lost their health care or are going bankrupt. Over the last eight years, we've seen that dream diminish
0	1	I want to have an education system that sets high standards, local control of schools and strong accountability. I'm running to get some things done for America
2	0	he's in the arena. it includes everything within the range of taxation
1	1	The way you get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. we want a better America as we go into the next century
0	1	I believe that life begins at conception. those are the reasons why I'm pro-life
2	0	We've got four children. The freeze people were wrong
2	0	a research and development tax credit. She called it the gold standard
0	1	Saudi Arabia, nothing but money. We protect Saudi Arabia
0	1	We can continue traveling the road we have been on, which has led to higher unemployment and worse economic times, or we can reach out for change. Sometimes it seems deceptively easy to continue with the old habits even when they're no longer good for us
1	1	our long-term security depends on our deep faith in liberty. The great threat to our country is that these haters end up with weapons of mass destruction
2	0	I would like to appoint people who would be interested in helping with that. our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd
2	0	We can work with the entertainment industry to provide family hour. the president is driving the largest deficits in American history
2	0	We worked together. I want the federal government, consistent with local control and new accountability, to make improvement of our schools the number one priority
0	1	Regions Vital to U.S. Interests. There's been no change in my attitude at all
0	1	in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America's strengths. It isn't necessary to run America down in order to build her up
2	0	The United States today, according to Prime Minister Rabin of Israel, is a- at a peak in its uh - influence and power in the Middle East. we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient
2	0	This is the world's largest sponsor of -- of terrorism. if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down.
2	0	90 percent of our kids are out there in those public schools. in my judgment it was a proper action
0	1	This seems to be a trend. it wasn't very detailed
0	1	I am against quotas. no quotas
2	0	we need to be lighter and quicker and more facile and highly trained. Everything is a gift from the Almighty
2	0	We're going to go through a period of shared sacrifice. you have to make a decision
0	1	I don't ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific, or rice paddies and jungles in the in Asia or the muddy battlefields of Europe. I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace
2	0	Tell it to anybody who understands how to makes democratic capitalism work. it’s not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody
2	0	it was not one of my ads, either, Governor. It was a threat
0	1	We've spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that. which costs about six billion dollars a year, the most expensive in history
2	0	We want to put more responsibility on the lawyers to require, before a case, malpractice, which the vice president just spoke about, have the case reviewed by independent experts to determine if the case is serious and meritorious before it can be filed. We don't want to change the legislation that would lower the tax rate in D.C.
0	1	even before the bill passed we'd moved nearly two million people from welfare to work, working with states and communities. I think when you look at those results, you know the plan I've laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if you'll give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st Century
0	1	we've got all kinds of agreements on paper. It's a very unstable situation
0	1	we used that as a role model, the way he took understandable pride in his heritage, what his family means to him. I would say that the concept of the Dukakis family has my great respect
2	0	it's essential that we have strong alliances. Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth
0	1	We have a democracy in Portugal today. We have been successful in Portugal
2	0	he's trying to make you believe it. We have to guard our energy companies
0	1	All those changes in our tax code would make a difference. I want to close loopholes that allow companies to deduct expenses when they move to China
2	0	terrorists became emboldened. I think you can work on all three at once
2	0	it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them. I think you ought to consider doing something about it, and voting for an Independent in 1980
2	0	we need to ban partial birth abortions. My opponent had trouble, criticized us, on our policy in Angola
0	1	I want the families to have the choice. we have a big difference on child care, for example
1	1	I cannot see where a $.50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline. we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time
0	1	I represented upstate New York. I support the Second Amendment
2	0	you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president. Russia hasn’t paid any attention to ISIS.
0	1	The Strunk family in Allentown, Pennsylvania, I campaigned with them the other day. They make $51,000 combined income, they pay about $3500 in taxes
0	1	the leadership of this government did not pursue wise policies. This brings up the whole question of what Presidential leadership is all about
0	1	I went and I volunteered, and I went to Vietnam. I didn't do the most or run the greatest risk by a long shot
2	0	They don't believe in free elections. Then it went to the Russians and said, let's see if you can do something
0	1	I wanted the American people to know I was willing to give up something. I put my career on the line
1	1	I've been president we have sold to the Israelis over $4 billion in military hardware. it's a deviation from a commitment to our major ally in the Middle East, which is Israel
0	1	It's a $500 per child tax credit. it's a six-point package
0	1	I think these questions are inherently personal and moral. I think it cannot work
1	1	That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president. If we continue under Mr. Ford's policy by 1985 or '90 we'll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons
0	1	we have gone after Al Qaeda's leadership like never before. Osama bin Laden is dead
2	0	I think probably we're making a mistake night after night after night to cast the nation's future on a unit that small. Soldiers must understand why we're going
2	0	the American people must remember that those soldiers were under an American commander when that happened. I am the one who's in the middle on this
0	1	I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, he's a man I know from Mexico. I talked to him about how best to expedite the exploration of natural gas in Mexico and transport it up to the United States so we become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil
0	1	that's what we did in Texas. we need to make sure that if we decontrol our plants that there's mandatory -- that the plants must conform to clean air standards, the grandfathered plants
0	1	he would have been stronger and tougher. the world would have been a lot worse off
2	0	it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year. we're not doing what we ought to do in terms of the technology
2	0	when you're a senator from Massachusetts, when you're a colleague of Ted Kennedy, pay go means: You pay, and he goes ahead and spends. I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else
0	1	when we're weak at home - weaker than all our allies - that weakness weakens the whole free world. we, in this country, have let our economy go down the drain
2	0	Let me tell you what your plan is. It's not Social Security plus, it's Social Security plus huge debt. that cost us revenue
0	1	to those who are poor, who don't have adequate health care, who have been cheated too long with our tax programs, who've been out of jobs, whose families have been torn apart. We need to have a government that's sensitive to our people's needs
2	0	The United States must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal. That is a reign of terror
2	0	They set a low standard of materialism. 11 million new jobs and everything
2	0	Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others. I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military
2	0	I think that's all wrong. I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes
2	0	has been tested. Government doesn't create jobs
2	0	there is a - a movement as I travel around the country of greater interest in this campaign. I know how to lead
0	1	a plan is not a litany of complaints. It's an empty promise
1	1	I want us to get to 100 percent. get costs down and keep quality up
0	1	that runs counter to what the United States of America is all about at our core. Imagine what it -- what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity
2	0	If you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit. It’s not on the ballot.
0	1	They've lost sources of tax revenue. they're facing a financial and social crisis
0	1	We also are going to make sure that we do not go forward with the tax cut proposals of the administration. of John McCain, the existing one for people making over $250,000, which is $130 billion this year alone
0	1	Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they’ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two
0	1	in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education. I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget
0	1	I think that could help. I would specifically target Baghdadi
0	1	Our tax structure is a disgrace. it needs to be reformed
2	0	I have given every bit of evidence, answered every question that's as- been asked me by any senator or any member of the House. how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country
2	0	That was actually mine, actually, Mr. President. You're judged by the entire record.
2	0	I want them to be tougher. I will never send troops anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back
0	1	I think the tone of this campaign could have been very different. I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns
0	1	having a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employees. This is the kind of change that would be made
0	1	we want family leave. there's a better way to do it
0	1	Civil rights -- we're for it so long as it's voluntary. You said: we're for it as long as it's voluntary
0	1	which means more and more government. Governor Carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs
0	1	I think it's true that we shouldn't apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people. I certainly would not impose any litmus test
2	0	"In other words, we're going to take Joe's money, give it to Senator Obama, and let him spread the wealth around. My opponent at one time said, ""Well, get me elected, I'll have them out of there in six months."""
0	1	let's set the record straight. I was able for two years when I was in, a very young boy to go to a Catholic school
2	0	I think we have a ways to go. And Barack Obama at first said he would not do that
2	0	I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed. That's math that doesn't add up
0	1	If you earn $200,000 a year, you got a $25,000 tax cut. If you earned between $20,000 and $40,000, you may have gotten about $1,000 between ten and twenty, close to a hundred dollars
2	0	We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead. what is he going to say to those people that show up at the summit? Join me in the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place
0	1	that is to get a better rate of return on the Social Security monies coming into the trust. there's a third way
0	1	It's all too easy for somebody in the majority in the population to say oh, we're just all the same, without an understanding of the different life experience that you've had, that others have had. Once you have that understanding and mutual respect, then we can transcend the differences and embrace the highest common denominator of the American spirit
2	0	if such a defense could be found, wouldn't it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people. they’ll overthrow you.
2	0	Over the last ten years since he's been governor, they're 30% behind, 30% -- they're 30% of the national average. that's why a lot of people refer to him as Tax-hike Mike
2	0	Ronald Reagan and I have put our trust in the American people. they have been wrong on virtually all of them
2	0	if we're going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources.. I want this nation to protect its air, its water, its land, and its public health
2	0	it's time that we had a president like Bill Clinton who can concentrate and will concentrate and work on the problems of real people in this country. I'll continue to do them as president
0	1	We don't have a patients' bill of rights because of one man today, the president of the United States. They've seen a lot of it during their administration
0	1	so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient. We're going to have to develop better community transportation systems
2	0	"It was due to go bankrupt in 1999 and that 50 million figure again, the newspapers -- I said -- you said forget the journalists, but they are the keepers of the score card. I remember the vice president saying, ""Just give us a chance to get up there, we're going to make sure you get tax cuts."""
0	1	They're going backwards on the definition for wetlands. We're going backwards
0	1	the new president of Pakistan, Kardari (sic), has got his hands full. If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government
2	0	The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them;. we're going to have to work with the -- with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they're on
0	1	I think if one is taking a look at my career they'll see that I level with the people. My feeling, quite frankly, is that I have enough experience to see the problems, address them and make the tough decisions and level with people with reference to those problems.
1	1	Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing. then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America
0	1	Companies are going to locate here depending on whether we've got the most highly skilled workforce. if we've got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, that's what's going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here
0	1	It would save a lot of money through more managed care, by giving more options, more preventative care and lowering the inflation rate. I have proposed a budget which would put ten years on the life of the Medicare trust fund
0	1	The 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the Congress that we help those families to get off of welfare. help those youngsters
1	1	my strategy is broader than that. we don't want another Afghanistan
0	1	that's a lot of new economic activity. I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad
1	1	That's not true. one of the proposals that Senator Gore has suggested is to have the taxpayers of America spend $100 billion a year on environmental projects in foreign countries
2	0	it's God's will, whatever happens. I think they're different
0	1	that's what's happening in Afghanistan and Iraq. Liberty can change habits
0	1	We need this kind of strength. we must increase our strength
0	1	I'm someone older than you. I've had my anxious moments in my life
0	1	We've had a lot of other presidents who didn't wear their country's uniform who had to order our young soldiers into battle, including President Wilson and President Roosevelt. the answer is I could do that
2	0	I've supported the President when I thought he was right on Bosnia. The same old experience is not relevant
2	0	our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities. We've got to try to have talks, understanding that we're not taking military options off the table
0	1	You cannot lead if you send mixed messages. that's my biggest concern about my opponent
2	0	You even called drilling -- safe, environmentally-friendly drilling offshore as raping the outer continental shelf. that I think has to be our policy
0	1	We've got to have a president that can lead on this issue. I'm prepared to do so
2	0	because nobody got it. Abraham Lincoln here is one of the most racist presidents we’ve had in modern history.
0	1	As a matter of fact, I brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the State of Texas to get a patient's bill of rights through. I do support a national patient's bill of rights
0	1	People in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, are not terribly thrilled with what's happening in the economy because they're standing in the light of a closed plant because they've lost their jobs.. the economy is not doing well
2	0	as for why it happened, I'm no expert on the Texas procedures, but what my friends there tell me is that the governor opposed a measure put forward by Democrats in the legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered. we would have a fight between Sunnis and Shias
0	1	The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts. We expect to have a lower deficit in fiscal year 1978
0	1	It's God's will. it'll happen
0	1	we ought to be able to preserve the democratic interests of the people of China. I would be firm
0	1	That is an art, to follow all those variables and know when to let up and to nurse this economy back together with pulls and pushes. there's no better man in the world to do that than that old artist, Ross Perot
2	0	I have been in the Congress and I've worked on these issues. I admire
2	0	the Russians must understand that these kinds of actions and activities are not acceptable. It's going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker -- Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill
0	1	Iran is more isolated today than when we took office. Let's all calm down a little bit here
0	1	Just on Monday of this week I signed a tax bill that included an amendment that would prevent companies in the United States from taking a tax deduction if they have in any way whatsoever cooperated with the Arab boycott. Again Governor Carter is inaccurate
0	1	if you vote the other way, you won't. I think what we have to do is convince people there is a big difference
0	1	Our tax rate for business in America is 35 percent. businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world
2	0	I also dropped the bottom rate from 15% to 10%. we need it not just when there's a crisis
2	0	That's not leadership. We've increased funds
2	0	It is important for NATO to have it work. I will not make age an issue of this campaign
1	1	I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them. Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don't understand drugs are wrong
0	1	It's a very, very significant piece of legislation. It'll provide prescription drug benefits to 40 million senior citizens
1	1	a lot of these things stopped in 1994. then came some other program
2	0	I don’t know Putin.. That's something the same Gen. Mike Ryan of the airforce and all the other chiefs of the services will not be happy about
2	0	North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability. Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies
2	0	it's lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter. It was perfectly legal
2	0	to give a targeted tax cut -- and let me talk about the education tax cut -- to let people have a $10,000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year, any kind of college tuition. which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it
2	0	We wanted to have majority rule with the full protection of the rights of the minority. It's absolutely true
0	1	It's a threat to the stability of the entire Middle East. our challenge right now is the Iranians continue on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons
0	1	What you just heard Governor Romney said is he doesn't have different ideas. we're doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate Syrian leadership and a -- an effective transition so that we get Assad out
2	0	given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy. the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women.
2	0	I don't say the Democrats are united in their support of the program.. it will get through in a George Bush Administration
2	0	which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us. I'm going to stand by Israel
0	1	Secretary of State Kissinger has done a superb job in working with the black African nations, the so-called front-line nations. I believe that we used our skill
2	0	I think we gave them a good opportunity. I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives
0	1	You're spending millions and millions of dollars in negative ads frightening senior citizens. all you've got going in this campaign is fear
2	0	with your wife being a teacher for 30 years. which is a combination of the budget cuts the president has, as well as the sequestration cuts
0	1	We've got to attack at all points. there can be no concessions under any circumstances
2	0	I'd like to see it expanded in two ways. Mr. Nixon uh - shows himself i- misinformed
0	1	tough, long game here Putin is playing a really. We need to make it very clear—whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else—the United States has much greater capacity
0	1	It’s an absolute disgrace. It’s a disgrace
0	1	The first president in 72 years to lose jobs. the president has presided over an economy where we've lost 1.6 million jobs
0	1	I want them to be tougher. absolutely not
0	1	I would hope by this time that Mr. Bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as I have. I respect his right to disagree with me
0	1	let's not cut into the muscle. let's not cut down our insurance policy, which is participation of American forces in NATO, the greatest peace- keeping organization ever made
2	0	We ought to make them disclose the people they've given money to when they're testifying before congressional committees. it's the largest number ever this year and they'll break the record next year and every year for ten years running
0	1	What we're proposing is to invest in the infrastructure in cities and have targeted tax incentives for investment right in inner city areas. The enterprise zones represent a part of our proposal also, and strengthening the family through welfare reform
2	0	they're not doing it. I think he called me racist, even
2	0	abortions ought to be more rare in America. I've just defined them
0	1	our B-2 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not. we are not equal in this treaty for one reason alone
2	0	It's nothing but a political tool. And in that neighborhood, it was filled with women and men, mothers and fathers who taught their children if they believed in themselves, if they were honest, if they worked hard, if they loved their country, they could accomplish anything
1	1	This wasn't a partisan victory that came suddenly, a few months after you took the oath of office. George Bush taking credit for the Berlin Wall coming down is like the rooster taking credit for the sunrise
0	1	I had 5 small children, and my family and I decided we would stay the course, and we lived with that problem for 3 years. Again and again, on complex, difficult tasks, I have stayed the course
1	1	"I don't believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary. he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges - that only judges that hold a certain, quote, ""view,"" on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government"
2	0	the idea of a terrorist in the middle of one of our cities with a nuclear weapon, is very real. In a recent 30-day period, 37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed
2	0	my opponent has got a plan of retreat and defeat in Iraq. It was a budget procedural vote
0	1	the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn’t put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn’t have the money to afford insurance and didn’t have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them
0	1	Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. You see that, their small car division leaving
0	1	We will use the military assets, we will use military assets - but we need to focus on another part of this problem, and that problem is law enforcement. We believe people convicted of that crime deserve the death penalty, as does the legislation that's in the Congress that is supported by a bipartisan, including many Democrats of his party
1	1	you are very selective, Mr. President. I don't think this issue should be politicized
1	1	I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that. I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found
0	1	I want to make sure prescription drugs are available for all seniors. I want seniors to have additional choices when it comes to choosing their health care plans
0	1	I think the opportunities and the possibilities are getting better. e will have solved many of the internal domestic problems that exist in South Korea at the present time
2	0	Imagine if we had pulled out at that point. I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we're making.
2	0	it's very difficult. It was a budget procedural vote
0	1	which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little. deal with mandatory minimum sentences
2	0	but itÏ€s not an insolvable problem. he was given a chance to vote, and he voted no
0	1	I think we have to be very reticent about that. I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas
2	0	that was a mistake. four years ago, I said that I'm not a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect president
2	0	It used to be the United States of America. Bill Clinton's top priority is putting America back to work
2	0	Somewhere in between those numbers. capital would flow out into the economy
2	0	have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis. will work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that
0	1	we could have rebuilt our country twice. it's really a shame
2	0	Got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying America is our friend. the United States remains vulnerable to such external shocks
2	0	There's been a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or delay enforcement of air pollution standards and water pollution standards. the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction,
2	0	has been tested. there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright
2	0	Well over a million and a quarter Americans are HIV-positive. I know Barbara and I are doing well
0	1	Mr. Bush, I don't question your patriotism.. When you're attacked for your military record
1	1	Even the administration has admitted they haven't done the training. that's how we're going to win the peace, by rapidly training the Iraqis themselves
2	0	He defended this country as a young man. I think you'll find the difference reflected in our budgets
0	1	because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize.. we were able to immediately stop the massacre there
2	0	The president has denied 9. 2 million women $3,800 a year. A neighborhood like most of you grew up in
0	1	We have been moving. America has not been standing still
2	0	We've also got to look to the future. We face a very big choice
2	0	the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment. that was what allowed us to become the number one state in the nation
2	0	Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it. President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments
2	0	They need to deal with ventilation systems. I know that the other ticket opposed this surge, in fact, even opposed funding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan
2	0	we think the key is to address some basic, fundamental issues that the president's already working on. here's what I've done since I've been president
0	1	if they get nuclear weapons, other people in the neighborhood will pursue their nuclear weapons, as well. I'll tell you what's worse A nuclear-armed Iran which triggers a nuclear arms race in the Middle East
0	1	If I were running it. I’d know what the plan is
0	1	Didn't even guard the ammo dumps. The president did not do what was necessary
2	0	on surplus military equipment - we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos. Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously
2	0	earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget. I'm surprised to hear him talk about records
2	0	we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally - a strong ally of the United States. I happen to think it's double that
0	1	Mr. Bush has referred to the embassy that was held in Iran, Well, I was at the White House in January, I guess it was, in '81, when those hostages, all fifty-two of them, came home alive. It was at that time that President Reagan gave a speech welcoming them home - as America did
2	0	only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers. I think we have to consider whether or not we should lift the arms embargo now on the Bosnians
0	1	we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative cost, bureaucracy, and government regulation that wouldn't be spent in any other nation. we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody
0	1	we ought to do is make those who wear the uniforms sacrifice. it's time we take a look at the pay scales
0	1	I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors. I want to make sure we're not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obama's health care plan
2	0	You voted for the war. you would seem him as president of the United States being very aggressive in this fight against crime, and having that kind of a successful result
2	0	Which is a big mistake. I will not support the cuts in Social Security and Medicare and the rest that the President has proposed
0	1	then in my judgment, providing he's behind action. I would have hoped that the president of the United States would have been possible for him to indicate it clearly that uh - the Supreme Court decision was going to be carried out
0	1	We have a good housing program, uh - that uh - will result in cutting uh - the down payments by 50 percent and uh - having mortgage payments uh lower at the beginning of any mortgage period. The Ford administration does have a very comprehensive program to help uh - our major metropolitan areas
0	1	He’s 10 years old now. This is the only country he’s ever known
2	0	there are a number of things. we can renew and rekindle the American spirit and make our future what our founders dreamed it could be
0	1	that position is that the United States has a treaty - a treaty with all of the Organization of American States - which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as wel. For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh - opposition to that treaty
0	1	One-time surge while we build factories and ship machine tools and equipment down there. Then year after year for decades, they will have jobs. Yes, it'll create bubble jobs
1	1	One of my promises is going to be Social Security reform. if you're a younger worker, if you're younger, you better hope this country thinks differently, otherwise you're gonna be faced with huge payroll taxes or reduced benefits
0	1	as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa. it's been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself
0	1	I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone. I would be willing to go ahead with negotiations
0	1	No Child Left Behind was implemented. we have got to increase the standards
0	1	they're the ones that are going to spend most of their life in the 21st Century. They're the ones who have the challenges
0	1	There is the Republican Guard in Iran. this is a serious threat
0	1	"Forty-nine -- 49 of our allies said ""out in 2014."". It's the responsibility of the Afghans"
0	1	that's not what you said. You did not say that you would provide government help
2	0	In Congress, I've been fighting for these sanctions since 2009. What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open
2	0	We do not have any program that encourages companies to close down here and to go and invest on foreign soil. We are facing absolutely massive deficits
0	1	I did have a life before that as well.. I wasn't born at the age of forty-three when I entered Congress
0	1	I don't want the federal government making decisions for consumers or for providers. I'm absolutely opposed to a national health care plan
2	0	During the time that the vice president and the president have been in office, 4 million more Americans have fallen into poverty. I'm confident that this country can meet its responsibilities
0	1	.So I believe that this election has become in part so—so conflict-oriented, so intense because there’s a lot at stake. It’s one of the most consequential elections that we’ve had.And that’s why I’ve tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president
2	0	We vote on resolutions. I think he's wrong
2	0	"the lines of stem cells that he's made available, every scientist in the country will tell you, ""Not adequate,"" because they're contaminated by mouse cells, and because there aren't 60 or 70 -- they're are only about 11 to 20 now -- and there aren't enough to be able to do the research because they're contaminated. we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally - a strong ally of the United States"
0	1	It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. No, you're wrong
2	0	We have an environmental crisis. I want people to have tax cuts
0	1	it is getting harder and harder to save, harder and harder to retire. on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids
2	0	This was an attack by terrorists. I don't trust the federal government
2	0	we've put it through a good economic model. I'm trying to do away with those the last ten days
0	1	we have one of the most aggressive adult education programs in the country. Our schools are now better
1	1	I didn't say we had the worst slums in the world. when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums
2	0	We do not help it. the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much
0	1	She had a small business with 63 employees. I met a lady in Colorado Springs about seven weeks ago now
2	0	we have had not one but two detailed studies which indicate that there are billions and billions of dollars to be collected that are not being paid these are not taxes owed by average Americans. we have seen mortgage rates back up again
2	0	it requires steadfast determination. I left my campaign and suspended it to go back to Washington
0	1	Had he been on the court, I suspect there would be a lot of changes that I don't like and the American people wouldn't like, including everything from Roe v. Wade to issues relating to civil rights and civil liberties. that was one of the intellectual changes that took place in my career as I got a close look at it
0	1	it would also be very disturbing to our allies, all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty. If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition
0	1	by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars. In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower's Administration, this situation has been reversed
2	0	Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. I don't believe, like the vice president does, in huge government
0	1	I've worked in my State to reduce teen pregnancy and illness among children. I know it's tough
2	0	We think that was important. The United States must be a nation strong
2	0	That is not how we grow the economy. what is at stake here in this health care issue is the fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama
0	1	so many of them depend on it for their basic living, for their livelihood. It has created a floor under which seniors cannot fall
2	0	I outlined a very specific program of increasing pay and allowances, reenlistment bonuses. But people that will respect the Constitution of the United State
0	1	to support the security of Israel. We have a very consistent policy in the Middle East
2	0	That was said sarcastically, and you know that.. Not some of the military
2	0	She’s a fighter. we're paying attention to it
0	1	I said we would change the way welfare works. even before the bill passed we'd moved nearly two million people from welfare to work, working with states and communities
2	0	it seems to me that there should have - be an opportunity, uh - as long as it's voluntary, as long as there is no uh - compulsion whatsoever, that uh - an individual ought to have that right. We stopped that plan before
0	1	I noted that nobody was really benefitting except a very small group at the top. The average person wasn't benefitting
0	1	I have been willing to stand up to powerful interests like the big insurance companies, the drug companies, the HMOs, the oil companies. I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the -- the policies and the laws to their advantage
2	0	We have people with no property. The problem with this version of Niagara Falls is that Senator Dole and Mr. Kemp would put the economy in a barrel and send it over the falls
2	0	which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now. if you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover
2	0	we held free elections. The administration was blocking us every step of the way
0	1	We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil. We've got to do it now
0	1	Children across our country don't have health care. the larger issue that we don't cover Americans
2	0	throughout all that time the people I have fought for have been the middle-class families. there are some Democrats who agree with our approach
1	1	It's time for a new administration to deal with the energy problem. The administration did not deal with it
0	1	We've got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college. Over the last eight years, we've seen that dream diminish
1	1	I'm not going to make decisions that I think are wrong for America. My opponent is for joining the International Criminal Court
2	0	You voted for the war. doesn't make sense
2	0	I've argued that we should fully funded it. It is believed that probably 70% of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there
0	1	We want to balance this budget, get back to fiscal responsibility. We have a plan
0	1	my judgment is that they don't want to give their freedom up to become Communists. I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom
0	1	I've been fighting for proliferation the entire time -- anti-proliferation the entire time I've been in the Congress. we've watched this president actually turn away from some of the treaties that were on the table
2	0	I think it–Kellyanne Conway.. No
0	1	I think what you can do is look at what they've done and recognize that they're not going to do very much in the future. an arms race doesn't lead to anything, it leads to another arms race and that's that
0	1	incomes are down. My priority is making sure that we get more people hired
0	1	since the reserve was opened the price of oil on world markets has dropped $6 a barrel. Al Gore and I believed it was important in the short-term to reach into the strategic petroleum reserve
2	0	just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldn't be, doesn't mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere. to produce the traditional kinds of American energy
2	0	Now they have. Right now, I am the Democratic Party.
2	0	we will do that. The bills that I vetoed, the one for an additional $6 billion, was not a bill that would have solved our unemployment problems
0	1	We've seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time. they're starting to finally make progress
0	1	You cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem. that's to make sure the education system works
0	1	We've done so in my own state. I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime
2	0	It’s called prepaying your taxes.. It's much more complex
0	1	But it wasn't just that experience tapped into, it was my connection to the heartland of America. My experience as an executive will be put to good use as a mayor and business owner and oil and gas regulator and then as governor of a huge state
0	1	They're always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that. And of course Kuwait
2	0	I'm thankful that the Constitution would allow a bit more authority given to the vice president also if that vice president so chose to exert it in working with the Senate and making sure that we are supportive of the president's policies and making sure too that our president understands what our strengths are. the grand parents are faced with
0	1	with safer mines, but also it's clean burning. We need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction
2	0	The problem with this version of Niagara Falls is that Senator Dole and Mr. Kemp would put the economy in a barrel and send it over the falls. They delivered
2	0	we created an OSHA - an Occupational Safety and Health Agency - for the protection of employees before the Federal Government had one in place. It's an election about the course of America
2	0	Hundreds of people came up to me and said: God bless America. the fact of it is we're so far away from research that even comes close to that
2	0	NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future. I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on earth
1	1	if we continue to spend billions on them, will force us to cut Social Security, to cut Medicare, to cut these basic entitlements to people of very, very modest means. I'm not going to go to entitlements as a means for cutting that deficit when we're spending billions on something like Star Wars, when we're spending billions on other weapon systems which apparently the Vice President wants to keep in his back pocket or some place
2	0	The person who wants to use a gun for an illegal purpose can get it whether it's registered or outlawed. part of the reason we have a difficult situation
0	1	put a unified court system in. While I was governor of Georgia, although I'm not a lawyer, we had complete reform of the Georgia court system
0	1	We need to get rid of that provision. It wasn't thought through properly
2	0	They sent 40,000 American troops into Iraq without the body armor they needed. They passed the budget
0	1	we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features. it's just about finished already
2	0	We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb. I believe in competition
2	0	we need to reverse that.People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.. He really didn't have a new economic program until over 1300 days into his presidency
0	1	The president said he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through that full process. He didn't. I think he has not been candid with the American people
0	1	it wasn't a tactic. That's what's happening in Iraq
0	1	One of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure. it starts with making sure we have strong accountability
0	1	it's clear that the defense budget of this administration has taken defense as a percent of our national economy to a lower level than it was prior to Pearl Harbor. I don't think, Jim, that Bob Dole was suggesting that the defense of our country is a jobs or a socioeconomic program
0	1	we have a process in Washington where after you've served for a while you cash in, become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month, then take a leave, work on presidential campaigns, make sure you've got good contacts and then go back out. we have a strange situation
2	0	stop the federal government's program that now gives low-interest loans and job training funds to companies that will actually shut down and move to other countries. I cannot let that stand
2	0	Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries. this is a national security issue
0	1	We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. the nature of our military's changed
2	0	making sure that we're closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. he wants to do away with the Midgetman and the MX, the modernization or our nuclear capability
2	0	If laws need to be strengthened, like instant background checks. I believe the next president in January and February should go to work in building the strength of the United States
0	1	They started from that little area, and now they’re in 32 different nations, Hillary. that’s why ISIS formed in the first place
2	0	global warming needs to be taken very seriously. you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto
0	1	I think that was mean-spirited. I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training
0	1	Iran continued to sell oil to the United States. we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally - a strong ally of the United States
0	1	most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who aren't bigoted or aren't prejudiced. it's very important that we not overstep our bounds
2	0	I think it's time we get rid of PAC money. But I don’t want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them.
2	0	we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan. we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support
0	1	the decisions we make will have enormous practical consequences. Your responsibility is to show up on November the 5th
0	1	the focus should be where the problem is, which is the Congress of the United States, and particularly the majority in the Congress. The anti-Washington feeling, in my opinion, ought to be focused on the Congress of the United States
2	0	That is absolutely proved over and over again. we've got to control our own energy
0	1	You've got to go to the people. I think that's the essence of leadership
2	0	You work with Congress. He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for
0	1	we can enforce law. there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on -- not certainly only in this debate, but just in general on law
0	1	most of the new jobs will come from small business. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business
0	1	we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is. it exists also among those who are inadequately trained; that is, those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education
2	0	When you don't have any ideas, you don't have any agenda, and all you have is fear, that's all you can use. I would be firm
2	0	They ceded responsibility to dealing with it to the Europeans. take it away from the special interests and have people go to Washington to serve
1	1	I'm pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program. just a few years ago you said that's something you'd never do
0	1	we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent. they'll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions
0	1	We want a peaceful planet. We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they're going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war
2	0	when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige. I think is very important for us to let them assume more and more of the burden and for us to bring that money back here and rebuild our infrastructure
2	0	what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision. that is part of your plan
0	1	knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they're going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives. I think it's, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in
1	1	They only added a little bit back this year. The fact is that he's cut job-training money
2	0	we not only ask the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their share. I think we need a little bit of reality from Wasilla Main Street there, brought to Washington, DC
2	0	whether it's diabetes or cancer, they come to hospitals later and it costs America more. I think it would increase the influence of unelected staff members in the Congress who have too much influence already
2	0	Look at Oakland.. we have a genuine coalition to get this job done
0	1	I think it's something that people need to consider. I think credibility is important
2	0	I believe I can. Look at your pension
0	1	step one was a rescue package that was passed last week. we've got to take some decisive action
2	0	Culture of life is really important for a country to have. I think one of the ways we've been able to be so successful in Kosovo and Bosnia and Haiti and in other places is by having the technological edge
0	1	Our country's in deep trouble. that's the kind of thinking that our country needs
2	0	we also believe that gay and lesbians and gay and lesbian couples, those who have been in long-term relationships, deserve to be treated respectfully, they deserve to have benefits. those are not the things that count
0	1	I've got five boys. I'm used to people saying something that's not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I'll believe it
2	0	what we say. What we really should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the American people make the most of this future that's out there
2	0	Itâ€™s an important continent. research, speeding the drugs to market, testing, blood supply are very important elements of this
0	1	as far as strength derived from the people, the Congress, the secretary of state, the president, sharing in the evolution and carrying-out of a foreign policy, as far as strength derived from the respect of our own allies and friends, their assurance that we will be staunch in our commitment, that we will not deviate and that we'll give them adequate attention. in those respects, we're not strong
2	0	I think it's the people's money. That simply isn't true
0	1	It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work. the business can continue to compete
0	1	We're blessed with terrific soldiers, and extraordinary technology and intelligence. We need to have as well a strong military
2	0	Regulations that take property or reduce the value of some farmer or rancher or homeowner's property for wetlands or endangered species and take that property or reduce its value without compensating the owner. We in effect tried to make Israel the scapegoat for the problems in the Middle East
0	1	I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.. you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy
2	0	I think it's a cynicism in Washington. He is right
0	1	we have a difficult situation in Pakistan. I think it's so important for us to reverse course
0	1	There's no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on. they need to be eliminated
1	1	But he was the minority. this is the Persian Gulf War -- the most important event in his political lifetime and here's what Bill Clinton says. If it's a close vote, I'd vote with the majority
0	1	General Petraeus invited Senator Lindsey Graham and me to attend a ceremony where 688 brave young Americans. two Fourths of July ago I was in Baghdad
0	1	Warren Buffett is the one who’s gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. It’s called the Buffett rule
1	1	we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism. it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term
2	0	They want to stay free, independent perhaps of us, but certainly independent of the Communists. the point of my first statistics that I gave you - that - that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years - fifty years - by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists have benefited just the rich
2	0	We’re going to have borders in our country. If you think the Republican party is some place for you to come if you're narrow minded or bigoted or don't like certain people in America, the exits are clearly marked for you to walk out of as I stand here without compromise
1	1	You need to have a president you can trust. Can you really trust Bill Clinton?
2	0	I traveled to Waziristan. He has no record on reforming of health care
0	1	That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it.. I terminated the individual mandate
0	1	it's their future. It's important
2	0	I don't want the talents of any American to go to waste.. I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles
0	1	the reason they blame Russia because they think they’re trying to tarnish me with Russia. they always blame Russia
2	0	this is a family issue. that's the situation that was left when I got there
2	0	I think the FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS. we need campaign finance reform
0	1	they all say to me that we don't want defeat. I know what thatâ€™s like when an army is defeated
2	0	here he says he's going to be a fiscal conservative, all of a sudden. I have uh - added in the current year budget the funds for the National Park Service
0	1	They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest. I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent
0	1	we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance. These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people
1	1	Former Governor Racicot, as chairman of the Republican Party, said he thought that the Patriot Act has to be changed and fixed. I don't think the Patriot Act abridges your rights at all
2	0	My record shows that on controversial issues. they also know if they live in San Diego, Mr. President, if you're caught with 125 pounds of marijuana or less, you go back to Mexico
2	0	we've seen a situation in which, first, they voted to commit the troops, to send them to war. I think the most important thing I've learned from this process is what I now know about John Kerry
2	0	The Ford administration will not let down, will not eliminate or forget our obligation to the people of Taiwan. They’re the red states.
2	0	we don't believe our nation can stand 4 more years of what we've had under George Bush and Dan Quayle. It's not going to work if we open up a dialogue with Kim Jong Il
0	1	Let me say as well that I have also been a great supporter of public school education and that is something that Fritz and I feel very, very strongly about for the future of this country.. Fritz Mondale and I feel very strongly that if you educate your children that that's an effort and the way that you build up and make a stronger America.
0	1	I've always said that. we have to succeed
2	0	That's absurd. We should export the technology by investing in clean coal technology
0	1	Democrats and Republicans alike, I think, acknowledge his expertise there. Joe Biden, I think, is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country
2	0	we still have a significant deficit under each of their plans. we can be a partner with China
0	1	with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong America that's strong militarily and economically as we must be, an America that provides strong international leadership because we're true to our values.. It's one that we will solve and must solve
0	1	that question can only be answered by someone with the knowledge and experience and the judgment. where the United States of America can make a difference in preventing genocide
0	1	Glaspie's papers have been presented to the US Senate. That is absolutely absurd
1	1	If I'm president, I'll double them. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half
1	1	It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas. the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America
0	1	There are 55 American military in El Salvador. I went down, on the instructions of the president, to speak to the commandants in El Salvador and told them that they had to move with Mr. Magana, then the president of El Salvador, to respect human rights
0	1	I've met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage. it's not choice
2	0	I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions. I can make the hard decisions
2	0	I don't think that's a bad decision. I know the President's been puffing a lot on that.
0	1	we've developed oil and natural gas. We've cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades
0	1	Bill Clinton and I will create good, high-wage jobs for our people. Bill Clinton's top priority is putting America back to work
2	0	It is 1.3 trillion Mr. Vice President. I don't think that anybody can say that Johnson and Kennedy neglected the poor and the destitute people in this country or around the world
0	1	John McCain would acknowledge that. I have a history of getting things done in the United States Senate
2	0	Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous. the United States remains vulnerable to such external shocks
2	0	We've got the highest inflation we've had in twenty-five years right now, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago. at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers' salaries
0	1	"I was in uh - a city in uh - Pennsylvania not too long ago, near here, and uh - there were about four or five thousand people in the audience - it was on a - on a train trip. And I said, ""How many uh - adults here are out of work?"" About a thousand raised their hands. Mr. Ford doesn't seem to put into perspective the fact that when - when uh five hundred thousand more people are out of work than there were three months ago, while we have two and a half million more people out of work than were when he took office, that this touches human beings"
2	0	I'm spending my money on this campaign; the 2 parties are spending your money, taxpayer money. Those are very clear differences
0	1	I would not meet Mr. Khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level - foreign ministers or ambassadors - which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success, or a useful exchange of ideas. On the question of the summit, I agree with the position of Mr. Nixon
0	1	I’ve heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, job-wise, safety-wise, in every way possible. It’s just words
0	1	that's creating jobs. we're also starting to build cars that are more efficient
2	0	I said we had too many slums. we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world
0	1	You got a 265 billion dollar tax increase. Now all you got that tax cut
1	1	the policies he's expounding of putting conditions on M.F.N. and kind of humiliating them is not the way you make the kind of progress we are getting. I would say if you want to continue as Most Favored Nation status for your government owned industries as well as your private ones, observe human rights in the future
2	0	I can't do that. I have no idea
0	1	I don't think that uh - America can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new programs uh - that would add significantly to the federal budget. I think the American people would be willing to make those sacrifices for peace and prosperity in the next uh - four years
0	1	the Soviet Union simply doesn't intend to carry out what they say. so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit - a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is
2	0	When I was growing up in Los Angeles, a family that median level of income might have sent four or five percent of their income to the federal government. We need a president who will speed up the training of the Iraqis, get more staff in for doing that
2	0	Stop some of this senseless litigation and let people work in America. This brings up the whole question of what Presidential leadership is all about
2	0	Our family does. hold the lawyers responsible for that, certify that and hold the lawyer financially responsible if they don't do it; have a three-strikes-and-you're-out rule so that a lawyer who files three of these cases without meeting this requirement loses their right to file these cases
0	1	the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy. doesn't make sense
2	0	In some circumstances. it's just a welfare program for the rich
0	1	The Vice President is right. Every day is earth day if you own the land
1	1	I'm going to shut that loophole. You get more money, you keep more of your taxes by going abroad
1	1	4th in income increase. in almost every category they're lagging
0	1	I want to honor that among his other achievements here. Mel Carnahan in Missouri had the finest record on diversity in any governor in the entire history of the State of Missouri
2	0	he failed to achieve that. And in that neighborhood, it was filled with women and men, mothers and fathers who taught their children if they believed in themselves, if they were honest, if they worked hard, if they loved their country, they could accomplish anything
0	1	It doesn't even pay for 10 percent of their proposed deficit spending increases. What we are saying is, lower tax rates across the board and close loopholes, primarily to the higher-income people
2	0	The people in Youngstown, Ohio, have stores that are boarded up. It denigrates an alliance to say we're going alone, to discount their sacrifices
2	0	I will bring fresh credibility, a new start, and we will get the job done right. four years ago they campaigned on getting prescription drugs for seniors
2	0	let me simply say for the record, I did not vote to cut COLAs. my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts
2	0	That's what a leader does. there's going to be an Arab summit, of the neighborhood countries
2	0	the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980. We haven't adequately funded veterans' care
2	0	we are not for more tax cuts for multimillionaires. I'm not questioning his patriotism
0	1	they serve all around the world and do an incredible job in a very dangerous situation. first of all talk about our diplomats
2	0	a stagnant economy that promotes more government dependency. My balanced budget covers mammograms for ladies, women on Medicare
2	0	I agree that we need to cut spending in Congress. Forty-nine percent increase in funding for elementary and secondary education under No Child Left Behind
2	0	I believe if we find poor children trapped in schools that won't teach, we need to free the parents. starting with Senator McCain's statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound
2	0	I’m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. I have brought into the top level, top levels of government, into the White House, into administrative offices of the Executive branch, into the judicial system, highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded
2	0	They'll do fine whether you're president or I am. I got rid of the individual mandate
0	1	I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee. I think that this is what we should concentrate on
2	0	Cuts in national defense. Together we can go forward and lift America up to meet her greatest dreams
0	1	This is public ethics. you have 30-some in your administration, either left or being investigated or in jail or whatever, then you've got an ethical problem
0	1	I don't think you can deny that. when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work
0	1	The President held it up. The President was opposed to it in 1993
0	1	The last candidate who indicated that he knew who his cabinet was going to be was Mr. Dewey in 1948. I don't think it's a wise idea for presidential candidates to appoint the members of his cabinet prospectively, or to suggest four people - indicate that one of them surely will be appointed
2	0	They risk their lives every day to take care of us.. We have to have modernization
2	0	The best thing to do is to look at the record uh - of Mr. Ford's Administration and Mr. Nixon's before his. We are a force of good in the world
2	0	That election will put in place a democratically elected government that will take over next December. I'm always one that defends the Central Intelligence Agency
1	1	That's not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade. Mr. Ford made up for it with three embargoes, one against our own ally in Japan
2	0	he'll do an outstanding job. take it away from the special interests and have people go to Washington to serve
2	0	He pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one.. It isn't really that.
2	0	if I've done him an injustice, and he didn't say it. part of our plan is to make it what they call portable
0	1	They're hurting. they're angry
2	0	Governor Clinton said, well, I might have been with the minority. they support it without restriction and with taxpayer funding
0	1	Create jobs and opportunities. I think that's that's the thrust we will make
1	1	Suggestion that somehow all of it is going for tax cuts isn't true. Our opponents are going to spend $1.6 trillion of the $1.8 trillion surplus projected on that big tax cut that Al Gore talked about the other night so effectively
0	1	Today, according to Prime Minister Rabin, the Soviet Union is weaker in the Middle East than they have been in many, many years. The United States today, according to Prime Minister Rabin of Israel, is a- at a peak in its uh - influence and power in the Middle East
1	1	I'm interested in working with our nations and do a lot of it. My opponent is for joining the International Criminal Court
0	1	I've actually been a governor for 12 years. I've known a lot of people who have lost their jobs because of jobs moving overseas
2	0	they outnumbered us 64 to 36 in submarines and 20 percent more bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles than we had. this isn't basic research
0	1	I also want to make sure that we get this economy going. I'll get us on track to a balanced budget
2	0	When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted. we're on the track on this one
2	0	we do some of the things that I think have to be done insofar as doing a better job of procurement. I can't understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare
2	0	not once, but twice - in 1971 - I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools. we're not in the habit of assigning guilt before there has been proper evidence produced and proof of that guilt
0	1	I'm not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.. I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we're making.
0	1	Sounds good, doesn't work. Typical politician
0	1	I happen to believe it is. I also think that that unborn child has a right to be wanted
2	0	who's a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts. we will start putting together teams to put together--to take all the plans that exist and do something with them
0	1	A commitment to grow the economy while protecting the environment. my plan for the 21st Century is a better plan
0	1	the other 99% have had an awful lot to do with building the surplus in our prosperity. I don't think we should give nearly half of it to the wealthiest 1%
2	0	The issue of our natural resources; the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be?. I think the next president of the United States should make one last effort to secure an agreement on the cessation of tests
0	1	We didn't fund a lot of other things this year, like the savings and loan mess. we're going to pay a big price for right after the election
2	0	I said they need -- these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy. I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility
2	0	he had quotas. I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building
2	0	This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase. As an aid to enlistment. we had an aid - 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I. Bill of Rights
2	0	You have to look at what he did.. that's our position - separation of church and state, pluralism, respect for all
2	0	they're choking to death on the air pollution. I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs
2	0	Stop some of this senseless litigation and let people work in America. I don't ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific, or rice paddies and jungles in the in Asia or the muddy battlefields of Europe
0	1	he will not advise me in the White House. that's Mr. Ayers
2	0	I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under. I'll do everything I can to minimize the need for abortions
2	0	If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy. Donald, she has a name
0	1	that's $8 trillion. No, it's not settled
1	1	If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel. it's a deviation from a commitment to our major ally in the Middle East, which is Israel
2	0	My association with Mr. Perot is a very personal one. You know, one of the challenges over the last decade is we've done experiments in nation building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and we've neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system
0	1	that committee under Secretary Hills released about a seventy-five-page report with specific recommendations so we can do a better job uh - the weeks ahead. we will really do a first-class job in helping uh - the communities throughout the country
1	1	I don't think we should give up on the private schools and leave kids trapped in failing schools. in his plan he proposes to drain more money, more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves
0	1	I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa. We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa
2	0	it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily. nobody's going to question my patriotism as the vice president has now repeatedly.
0	1	I am not. I'm not questioning his patriotism
2	0	that is not right. Under my plan, they get $1800 of tax relief
2	0	I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country.. we are in trouble
0	1	we've suffered. It's not the America that we have to have in the future
2	0	we have an employer-based system. What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy
0	1	you can invest some of your own money. There's just a difference of opinion
0	1	take the money from the defense cuts. This will work
2	0	I do take issue with some of the principle there with that redistribution of wealth principle that seems to be espoused by you. We think this has a devastating impact on the quality of health care
2	0	he said those successes are fragile. Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut
0	1	Our schools are not educating. We need to reform education
0	1	If we're not training engineers to make sure that they are equipped here in this country. Then companies won't come here
0	1	I will not give anyone special treatment. that's my position
0	1	We're a nation that believes in the Second Amendment. I believe in the Second Amendment
1	1	It's time to end it. it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's been in place for a hundred years
0	1	People can judge who I am. I haven't changed in that time
0	1	When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic. I've been kind of a hard-liner on this issue for more than eight years
0	1	It is possible to get people to work together and to begin to focus on achieving results. I think it will take new leadership
2	0	I do. we take some programs that we are doing to keep, like Medicaid, which is a program for the poor; we'll take that healthcare program for the poor and we give it to the states to run
0	1	Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem. I have brought into the top level, top levels of government, into the White House, into administrative offices of the Executive branch, into the judicial system, highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded
2	0	we've made it clear, along with our allies, that when Milosevic leaves, then Serbia will be able to have a more normal relationship with the rest of the world. we discovered that the program that the Carter-Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of Social Security for the next 50 years wouldn't solve them for 5
0	1	if you reform these programs for my generation, people 54 and below, you can guarantee they don't change for people in or near retirement. the best way to do it is reform it for my generation
0	1	they're our job creators. Don't raise taxes on small businesses
0	1	It's their route to the sea. It's the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel
2	0	How is raising taxes going to help small business?. we will be in there together and we will figure out what to do
0	1	That's the way we leave it. If you like your high premiums, you keep them
0	1	the White House is a bully pulpit. I think whoever's in the White House should just make it absolutely unconscionable and inexcusable
2	0	we're peacekeepers. it's for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need
2	0	tax cuts for child care. I want to do something about that
2	0	They're working harder and higher and harder paying more taxes. because people like her—and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart
0	1	He disbanded the club, but he's still got the money. He is the number one - he is the number one receiver of political action committee money
0	1	I truly believe that's the way to get from how we live today to being able to live a standard of living that we're accustomed to and being able to protect our environment better, the use of technologies. we'll continue to spend money on research and development
0	1	That's $7 trillion. that's $8 trillion
2	0	it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide. I wouldn't join the International Criminal Court
2	0	These are places where people can get primary care. my plan say why don't we pass 1.3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills?
2	0	We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954. I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids
2	0	it's such an assault on their humanity and their citizenship. obviously we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use force
2	0	Instead of doing something about that. We really have two economies
2	0	Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing. It's much more complex
0	1	Eleven o'clock that same day, two Mondays ago, John McCain said that we have an economic crisis. That doesn't make John McCain a bad guy, but it does point out he's out of touch
2	0	I have more experience than others that have sought the office of Vice President. we've got to get help from the Congress in order to do this
0	1	15 percent of Americans are living in poverty today. we're going in the wrong direction
2	0	I cannot foresee what emergencies might develop in this country. It was a bad decision for America
0	1	there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush. there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush
2	0	"One is Strobe Talbott in his classic book, ""Deadly Gambits.''. most of them members of working families who don't have a dime of health insurance and don't know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night"
2	0	That has escalated now to sixteen and a half million dollars, in the last uh Republican administration. they're fighting so vociferously
2	0	This doesn't mean that the people aren't going to be paying the bill. I'm not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game
0	1	With the end of the Soviet Union, the implosion of the empire, that created a vacuum if you will, and made it easier for us to operate there. We were able to, I think, reassure both Arabs and Israelis would play a major role there
2	0	it's true. I don't think I can understand fully what it would be like
1	1	he left the senate, we abandoned that. Ours are permanent, ours is a good plan
0	1	what we don't want to do is give our allies reason to trust us less and our enemies more. what any administration will do in 2013 is assess the situation to see how best to complete this timeline
0	1	We have attempted to persuade Chiang Kai-shek as late as January of 1959 to reduce the number of troops he has on them. This is a serious issue
2	0	indeed, every time it has increased you will find there is an increase in minority unemployment among young people. The man loves his wife and I appreciate that a lot
2	0	all that did, saw friends die, but that heightened my convictions about peace. starting with Senator McCain's statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound
0	1	that's been the result by this dumb idea that was cooked up in the White House basement. I would speak up on that type of thing
2	0	The second time, with our Marines, the gate was open. it's hard work
0	1	we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office.. You better take a look at that
1	1	The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the -- the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these -- these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world. That's not the right course for us
2	0	even people that have a job are afraid that they're going to be fired. At one time, and most of the time in the House of Representatives, you had a pro-life position
0	1	all the people that have dropped out of the workforce. the unemployment rate seems a little lower today
2	0	I have a plan to provide health care to all Americans. She'll be my partner
2	0	They'll have more than Great Britain sometime in the -- in the relatively near future. That is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the Middle East
2	0	when there are elections, people tend to vote for peace. it was a surprise to us
0	1	they were going to do something about health care in this country. And they've done something: They've made it worse. They've seen a lot of it during their administration
2	0	We need to battle them overseas. We will stop it again
0	1	Barack had 94 opportunities to side on the people's side and reduce taxes and 94 times he voted to increase taxes or not support a tax reduction, 94 times. Barack Obama and Senator Biden also voted for the largest tax increases in U.S. history
2	0	Our neighbors here in America are vital to us. it's all a question of what our priorities are
2	0	hen Walter Mondale was attorney general of Minnesota, he led the fight for a man who could not afford to get justice because he couldn't afford a lawyer. We can't afford that kind of growth in federal spending
2	0	put our people back to work. I agree with him
2	0	Exaggerations like, for example, only 5% of seniors receive benefits under my Medicare reform package. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered our factories
2	0	None of them uh are responsible for health care itself. his judgment's flawed
2	0	some who do not like America. I am suggesting the way to work out of poverty is through real opportunity
0	1	.I ask Hillary, why doesn’t—she made $250 million by being in office. She used the power of her office to make a lot of money. Why isn’t she funding, not for $100 million, but why don’t you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?It’s $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public.
2	0	I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it's dangerous to say this to the people. Described under your plan, Governor Bush, states would be required to pay vouchers to students to match the vouchers so that the federal government would put up
2	0	you would expand the economy. We have moved in Latin America very effectively
2	0	"we're fully staffed in our firehouses and that we protect the nuclear and chemical plants. I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, ""Ford to New York: Drop Dead."""
2	0	They're gone. I want to go further
1	1	We need to spend more money on the infrastructure in Afghanistan. Look, we have spent more money -- we spend more money in three weeks on combat in Iraq than we spent on the entirety of the last seven years that we have been in Afghanistan building that country
2	0	he will raise your taxes. They're not able to do it
1	1	Bill Clinton and I want to change that. George Bush's urban policy has been a tale of 2 cities: the best of times for the very wealthy; the worst of times for everyone else
0	1	people with stop-loss programs where they're told you can't get out of the military. this is the way the president has overextended the United States
2	0	if you would have supported that attitude. that's what he and his Harvard buddies think of the American farmer, grow Belgium endive
2	0	I don't understand your vote on veterans issues. the size of the federal government will go down in a Gore administration
2	0	The rest of the world practices 21st century capitalism. He cares about 100 percent of Americans in this country
0	1	And what the most striking and startling thing is, they are the first presidency in 70 years -- and I'm talking Democrats, Republican, presidents who led us through World War, through the Korean War, the Vietnam War, Cold War -- every one of them created jobs until this president. We have to do better
2	0	Choose your plan, and then Medicare subsidizes your premiums, not as much for the wealthy people, more coverage for middle-income people, and total out-of-pocket coverage for the poor and the sick. if an attack comes in the homeland, it's going to come as our security services have said, it is going to come from al Qaeda planning in the hills of Afghanistan and Pakistan
0	1	I support another one now. that means keeping our military strong
2	0	it asked the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more. The Nixons told this story
2	0	And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely—because if you read this article, there's no doubt. I want to release it.
1	1	yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal.. I don't think that's extreme at all;
2	0	that's how we're going to reduce demand. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis
0	1	those are the choices the next president of the United States is going to have to make. We've got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process, with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in Europe with deeper cuts on the Soviet side and Senator Bentsen
0	1	We resolved, we rescued Social Security. we will rescue Medicare as we did Social Security
2	0	Nothing’s going to ever happen. The best way to keep jobs here in America is, one, have an energy plan
2	0	He's president, not me, I'll give my best advice. First, I've suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and we can't afford
2	0	The democratic leaders of Central and Latin America want to work with us. I have a plan
2	0	we've had tough aggressive trade policies. This is one of the most important priorities that faces this country
0	1	There are more deductions in the tax code for shutting plants down and moving overseas than there are for modernizing plant and equipment here. change the tax code
0	1	You took General Motors bankrupt. when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did
2	0	The fact that the U.S. military is worse off today than it was eight years ago. I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way
2	0	You can be on welfare. America's future is going to bright as well
2	0	Small businesses are not going to have a mandate. vote in person
2	0	We have achieved extraordinary prosperity. When you get 99.5 percent of the money, we don't know what happened to the other .5 percent
2	0	We have 543 at present. I'm not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do
0	1	we'll have a fairer and flatter system. we're going to make the economic package work
2	0	They used to fish in troubled waters whenever they had the opportunity in the Middle East. I made it plain to them
2	0	Forty-one percent of those 10 million are women. This doesn't have to be
0	1	Thousands of shootings. we have to stop the violence
2	0	who's a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts. 9 Nobel Prize-winning economists and 500 others, including numerous Republican and Democratic business executives, have endorsed this approach
2	0	closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future. I think is very important for us to let them assume more and more of the burden and for us to bring that money back here and rebuild our infrastructure
2	0	Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns. you won't change the law
0	1	I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere. weâ€™d better get after it, we better start exploring it
0	1	I can see why you feel that cynicism and mistrust. I understand your frustration and your cynicism
0	1	in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh - interview had I do it - had it - I to do it over again. I'll use another forum besides Playboy
2	0	I said I had no recollection whatsoever of talking with any of the White House legislative liaison people. I think that we did the right thing there
1	1	She's been doing this for 30 years. in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently
2	0	I know what it takes to lead this country forward. the reason President Eisenhower's vetoes have been sustained - the reason the Congress does not send up bills to him which they think will be vetoed - is because the people and the Congress, the majority of them, know the country is behind the President.
2	0	I believe that we should not compare what our figures may be to India or some other country that has serious problems but to remember that we are the most prosperous country in the world and that these people are not getting adequate food they're not getting in many cases adequate shelter. That's not America
2	0	In fact it makes it less likely for them to come here. We've seen an administration that has lost much of our market abroad
0	1	Campaign finance might help. It might help the contributions from coming in from Indonesia or other foreign countries, rich people in those countries, and then being sent back after the L.A
1	1	"what's the message going to be: ""Please join us in Iraq. For a grand diversion. he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve"
0	1	It's an agenda that says we're going to reform Medicare to make sure seniors have got prescription drugs and to give seniors different options from which they can choose. I've got an agenda that I want to get done for the country
0	1	You have ancient ethnic rivalries that have cropped up as Yugoslavia's dissolved or getting dissolved. it isn't going to be solved by sending in the 82nd Airborne
2	0	there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we're having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy. I think it's wrong to demonstrate against your own country or organize demonstrations against your own country in foreign soil
0	1	It's unfortunate. We're in a situation today where our posture with Iraq is weaker than it was at the end of the war
0	1	so were non-profit agencies. so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing
0	1	We have to test every child every year to know whether or not we're making progress with respect to achieving those goals and objectives. We want accountability
0	1	We've got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties. I also believe that it is -- one of the reasons we can't do it is we're overextended
0	1	But he wasn't in the Senate with Senator Feingold. this man has no credibility on the issue
2	0	We learned our lesson again in Korea. It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid
0	1	we need to step up technical assistance. trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies
0	1	all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. In spite of his policies
0	1	we invested in national security. We won the Cold War
2	0	you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line. you didn't tell the American people the truth
0	1	A capital gains differential will increase jobs. increase risk taking
0	1	Let me say what a friend told me, and I believed it for my whole career, weakness is provocative and our message should be clear. that's what our message would be to the world under Bob Dole as Commander-in-Chief of the United States of America
2	0	the Playboy thing has been of great - very great concern to me. don't give up on making an extra effort until you're sure everybody has a chance to prove they're qualified
0	1	Abraham Lincoln had character. I would like to brag about the character of my boss
0	1	unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions. I was upset
2	0	Mine are words, and his was action. putting obsessive partisanship aside
2	0	in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq, but for our general demands across the globe. here's the problem: If we are giving them to oil companies, then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them
1	1	We believe people convicted of that crime deserve the death penalty, as does the legislation that's in the Congress that is supported by a bipartisan, including many Democrats of his party. He is opposed to the death penalty for drug kingpins
0	1	o spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all. We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent
0	1	I have a plan to let you buy into the same health care senators and congressmen give themselves. I have a plan
0	1	we'll have a better trained workforce. that will create jobs
0	1	the Voting Rights extension; it was extended for the longest period of time by President Reagan. I think our record on civil rights is a good record.
2	0	I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut. The American people want this environment protected
2	0	until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh - we cannot indicate what our plans will be. I wouldn't want to be a liberal either
0	1	I want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again. there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright
2	0	What I criticized was the failure of the Administration to use its great influence to persuade the Cuban government to hold free elections, particularly in 1957 and 1958. that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world
0	1	Renee Proval (ph) is probably better off than he was four years ago. I guess some may be better off
2	0	we have three percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil. This is how Donald thinks
2	0	We have achieved extraordinary prosperity. Yes, I think it's fine to do business with them
0	1	we put their lives at risk. We will suffer more casualties in the next conflict if we don't look to those basic fundamental problems now
2	0	I think we're both supportive of them. My plan has not only a short-term component, but also a long-term component
1	1	don't run her down in order to build her up. No longer do we give the image of being on the rise
2	0	He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. She came all the way from Iowa in a Winnebago with her poodle in order attend here tonight
2	0	they are the innocent bystanders here in what is the biggest financial crisis and challenge of our time. I want to make sure the equipment for our military is the best it can possibly be, of course
2	0	it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year. I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done
2	0	increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have - if the should launch a surprise attack - we will be able to destroy their war-making capability. it's a combination of these things
2	0	We have the lowest combined rate of inflation and unemployment in 30 years. it needed to be done the right way
2	0	He is protecting the Everglades here in Florida. Not in an election year
2	0	creating 12 million jobs over the next four years. a plan that I believe really will help stimulate the growth of this economy
0	1	I wasn't the one that said 5.4 percent. The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work
2	0	I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short. that is something that I would welcome
0	1	if you're a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it's 11 percent tax versus 35 percent. I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in -- in the United States of America and create jobs
2	0	We have done a lot more. I don't know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack
0	1	There are no more than a handful of American military personnel in Haiti now. That's what we did in Haiti
2	0	at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers. I favor it
2	0	was this wise. you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington
0	1	But we'd note that Mr. -- Governor Clinton's plan is almost twice as much a cut as either one of us. Bill Clinton wants to cut defense another $60 billion
0	1	It's a bad idea to increase the burden on those folks. That's not smart
1	1	We need campaign finance reform. that is the current campaign financing system
0	1	if they succeed, I believe the country succeeds. That's what I've been doing for the last four years
2	0	50th for families with health care. Bill Clinton's economic plan and his agenda will make matters much, much worse
1	1	That's the way you help people. they're still resisting
2	0	make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary. We're going into the next century a better America
2	0	how to control the cost of health care: medical liability reform. These constant suggestions that the basic Social Security System should be changed does call for concern and consternation among the aged of our country
2	0	It says to you as a taxpayer -- say you're going to pay a tax of 1000 bucks or something. That's not America
2	0	Programs like Project Exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns. there are summits being held
2	0	The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden. Again Governor Carter is inaccurate
1	1	This administration has turned around the drop in spending that began in the mid-'80's and right through the Bush-Cheney administration and the early years of the Clinton administration. I think that the administration has, in fact, in this area failed in a major responsibility
2	0	Four thousand people a day are coming across the border. I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important
2	0	A year ago, I went to Wall Street and said we've got to reregulate, and nothing happened. You don't send troops to war without the body armor that they need
2	0	I wouldn't join the International Criminal Court. the nature of our military's changed
2	0	We've got to have a president that can lead on this issue. as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy
2	0	We think it is appropriate to return to the American people. they said no
0	1	We've seen it before. This is nothing more than a tax-and-spend platform
0	1	first of all, said there has to be oversight. We're not going to write any check to anybody unless there's oversight for the -- of the secretary of Treasury.
2	0	step one was a rescue package that was passed last week. we're after Saddam Hussein -- I mean bin Laden
1	1	Being haunted, a thousand points of light. do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light
2	0	you act in order to make this country secure. they want the world
0	1	to waste less public money and invest more. That is my passion
0	1	now we're going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks.. We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges.
2	0	"When the Democrats, either, though, this last go- around for the last two years. I wrote a book about it several years ago -- six, seven years ago -- called ""The New War,"" which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network"
2	0	so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient. that means a strong military
2	0	I never said any such thing. We've got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war - uh - for the world in Asia, in Africa and Latin America
2	0	We're not going to make those kinds of mistakes. merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion
0	1	We have a good, stable economic policy. We're No.1 in automobile manufacturing production and sales around the world again, the first time since 1970s
2	0	We have to make sure this program is there for the long term. There are, as you know, CIA men stationed in other countries in the world and, certainly, in Central America
0	1	no drug therapy. there are a lot of procedures that haven't kept up in Medicare with the current times
2	0	That's totally false for him to stand up here and say that. it was a way to get ahead
0	1	keep our commitment to the elderly and maybe down the line. I am going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound
2	0	still in these waning days of the Bush administration, trying to forge that peace,. I think it's worth a shot
2	0	We have 35 million people without any insurance at all. the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country
2	0	of wiping Israel off the map. China and India are graduating more graduates in technology and science than we are
2	0	they're matters that are ah - important. that happened in 1993
1	1	You cannot have a war on drugs, you cannot be tough on drugs and weak on crime. He also was opposed to mandatory drug sentencing for drug dealers in the state of Massachusetts
0	1	you can't buy the sales pitch. You're going to lose some deductions
2	0	in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them. You got that wrong
2	0	They deserve the resources that we need to provide for them. a weapons system we don't need and can't afford
2	0	in the case of Mr. Nixon, the reason the - the pardon was given, was that, when I took office this country was in a very, very divided condition. That is the number-one threat we face in the world
2	0	Tragically, I was right. Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America
2	0	as far as - as strength derived from doing what's right - caring for the poor, providing food, becoming the breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world. We need to reform education
2	0	As the President said the other night, there will always be troubles in this ol' world, but the United States of America can be counted on to provide the vision that the world looks for from the United States of America. I've been a person who has to set a clear vision and convince people to follow
1	1	I would hope by this time that Mr. Bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as I have. there's got to be some penalties to enforce the law
2	0	"he didn't say tax rate cuts, he said ""tax cuts to everybody,"" including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because that's been his history. In January of uh - 1975 I submitted to the Congress and to the American people the first comprehensive energy program recommended by any president"
0	1	We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom - victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries - provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles. I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues - principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom
0	1	I'm in public service. I love this country
0	1	First and foremost, that is what we would engage in. No, diplomacy is very important
2	0	we've got to see around the corners. I think this is the right strategy
0	1	the test is not if you've added money. the test is that you've done everything possible to make America secure
2	0	I was a prosecutor for almost five years in the district attorney's office in Queens County and I was a teacher.. so we do support it
0	1	we need also to not get ourselves in debt. We need to make sure that as individuals we're taking personal responsibility through all of this
0	1	there are millions of women all across the country, who rely on Planned Parenthood for, not just contraceptive care, they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings. That's a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country
2	0	He broke his big promise to bring people together to solve the country's biggest problems. it’s going to be all over.
0	1	I'm the first president ever to allow funding -- federal funding -- for embryonic stem-cell research. I too hope that we'll discover cures from the stem cells and from the research derived
2	0	Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh - forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh - difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition - 1946 when price controls were lifted. we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles
2	0	we have—we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something. I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America
0	1	I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack - to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want. I have opposed drawing a line
2	0	We should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people. he said that he was not for choosing -- giving the parents the right to choose to send their children to public schools
2	0	we have troops on the ground there. That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor
0	1	if you’re under the age of 26. you can’t stay on your parents coverage anymore
2	0	I'll become a one-woman truth squad and we'll start tonight.. This is a peaceful nation
2	0	"we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition. I knew we'd have somebody out there yelling ""read my lips"", and I did it"
1	1	I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life. we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America
0	1	in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth. It's because they have lost their industry
1	1	I don't see how the Iraqis are going to have confidence in the American president. I don't think my opponent has got the right view about the world to make us safe
2	0	hat would add $5 trillion to the debt. Mr. Ford exclude himself from access to the public
2	0	That’s the highest we’ve ever been in our country. Ours are permanent, ours is a good plan
2	0	Leadership. Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her—took massive deductions
2	0	veterans' unemployment is actually now lower than general population. I take the pledge
1	1	he's doing a very effective job of that, in his way. he has a responsibility to be accurate
1	1	It's time to have a leader that doesn't put off tomorrow what we should do today. You leave future generations with tremendous IOUs
2	0	Whether or not he's willing to support the forces of freedom and democracy diplomatically there in the area of eastern Europe. This is a - a typical attitude that really causes havoc in people's lives
0	1	for the last eight years I've been on the National Security Council. I suspended campaigning for two days, or parts of two days, to go back and participate in the meetings that charted the President's summit meeting that he just returned from earlier today
2	0	the Republicans in recent years - not only in the last twenty-five years, but in the last eight years - have opposed housing, opposed care for the aged, opposed federal aid to education, opposed minimum wage. We do have a serious problem in our culture
2	0	The other party gives them lip service. Senator McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator
0	1	I support it. I haven't
0	1	Pass our Family Leave Act,. it goes to small businesses where the major problem is
2	0	it would blow a hole in the deficit. the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy
2	0	There is a very strong moral basis for this concept of equality of opportunity. The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home
1	1	don’t tell me about this.. there’s seven million people that contracted COVID.
2	0	I never said -- and I defy you to find where I said -- I gave an extensive environmental speech in April, and I said that we ought to have a goal of raising the fuel efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon. I think that you still have not gone into details about what your role in it was
2	0	We had to. A coup broke out in the Philippines
2	0	we are succeeding. it's expensive
2	0	He didn't. something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions
1	1	He didn't do any of those things. Then the president, in fact, promised them
0	1	Spending research and development money. we can use our technological base to figure out new uses for farm products
2	0	Ban an entire generation of intermediate nuclear force weapons. I don't believe that it's very much different from Mr. Benson's.
2	0	there needs to be a consequence at the federal level. Pakistan's weapons can already hit Israel and the Mediterranean
2	0	They were military.. If we're going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas
0	1	which will commit this nation to the resources to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention. which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victims of AIDS
0	1	but I was not quite sure if I were ever to become pregnant as result of a rape if I would be that self-righteous. I then spoke to him; he said, Gerry, that's not good enough
2	0	There won't be 10 millionaires and 14 lawyers in the cabinet. we will set as our goal a steady, gradual reduction of the deficit
2	0	There's a family in the audience tonight, the McNeil family, who lives right here in St Petersburg. Both parents are teachers, they're not rich in money, but they have strong values and they value education. we should be able to do that for our country
2	0	those days are over with. But on the major principle things, no, there hasn't been something that I've had to compromise on, because we've always seemed to find a way to work together
2	0	It comes out to $100 billion of foreign aid for environmental projects. they'll view us that way
2	0	By giving parents the tools to protect their children against cultural pollution. What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done it, his last statement, call for an unconditional end of the violence
2	0	pay our men and women more. I know I can do a better job in Iraq
0	1	It's far better for a person sitting in the White House uh - who has a number of options to make certain that the uh - other side, so to speak, doesn't know precisely what you're going to do. no president of the United States, in my opinion, should signal in advance to a prospective enemy, what his uhh - decision might be or what option he might exercise
2	0	which will commit this nation to the resources to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention. Test scores are going up
2	0	It's a fairness issue. that's what I had in mind
0	1	the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success. U-2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing
2	0	the interest on that debt next year, on this Reagan-Bush debt of our nation, is going to be $640 for every man, woman, and child in America because of this kind of a credit-card mentality. That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary.
2	0	we made the largest investment in clean coal technology. we have to make some kind of forecast
0	1	we're going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade. Here is the role of the federal government
0	1	We want everybody to succeed. That's what we're going to push for in a Romney administration
2	0	our cancer rate is uh - higher than any country in the world. that amendment put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of the Senator's own party voting for it
0	1	I'm here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare. Two days ago we ate lunch at a restaurant
2	0	I want you to have your own asset that you can call your own. The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there
2	0	she’s been there for 30 years she’s been doing this stuff. It's just not credible
0	1	They see us saying when we come into the administration, when they're sworn in, we need more space with our ally, Israel. Let's look at this from the view of the ayatollahs
0	1	Why not leave it with them?. Why take it in the first place if you're going to give it back?
0	1	including a $254 million refund check to Enron. Do you know what he presented us with? A $25 billion giveaway to the biggest corporations in America
2	0	about a brighter future for America. And has particularly informed my social doctrine
2	0	when I got to be a part of the current administration, it was right after -- I was one of the few members of my political party to support former President Bush in the Persian Gulf War resolution. I think I have better opportunity, however, of finding the necessary funds to pay what, admittedly, will be very, very substantial sums of money
0	1	it's not going to be easy. It is going to be requiring all of us -- Democrats, Republicans, independents -- to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility
0	1	in this case it's about a firmer policy with Cuba. This is a serious business
2	0	I notice particularly that he didn't endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform. I have no intention of wilting
1	1	they just can't afford it. there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers
0	1	if Congress doesn't get laid on, the covert activities which I opposed in Nicaragua, those CIA covert activities in that specific country, are not supported by the Congress. not supported by the majority of people throughout the country
0	1	we need good intelligence. You've got to have the best intelligence in the world
2	0	They have about 12,000. when they meet, that is a balanced budget
0	1	I’ve taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president. I’ve stood up to Russia
2	0	That year I happened to pay a lot of state and local taxes, which as you know are deducted from the other,. this is an unfair and unacceptable situation
2	0	he has broken that pledge repeatedly. I would quit conducting the decision-making process in secret
2	0	They're having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments. it is inappropriate for us, just because there's a problem somewhere around the world, to take the sons and daughters of working people
2	0	I said, if we do the things that I've set out and we are successful, we could begin to draw the troops down in six months. on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids
0	1	Vice President George Bush is going to recreate the Space Council. I will know them on a firsthand basis
0	1	It shouldn't happen in America. it's time we take a look at the pay scales
2	0	It's the hardest decision a president makes. we were committed to success in Iraq
2	0	China, Germany, they're making these investments. We ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom, who search for individual liberty, who search for basic human rights
0	1	right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP. We are going to start the engine rolling again
0	1	We have to get a handle on it. One of the serious problems, hear me well, is that our system of government is being undermined by too much influence coming from special interest money
0	1	I led for the Earl Wallop bill or formerly Dingell-Johnson. I am for clean water
2	0	I want to move you on to something that's sort of connected to cars here. I think he ought to be ashamed of mentioning that statement
0	1	In a discussion of our strategic arms negotiations, I said that submarines carrying missiles and airplanes carrying missiles were more conventional-type weapons, not as destabilizing as the land-based missiles. I never said any such thing
2	0	Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment. I am well aware of the present deficiencies in the Armed Forces of this country
0	1	The fact-finding committee's powers are limited. The difficulty now is the president's course is quite limited
2	0	I've dealt with many a president, and I don't hesitate for a minute to speak up. manufacturers here in the U.S. making the same products can't compete
0	1	I think if you take a look at where I've been, both in the Congress and where I intend to go, the type of person I am. I think that the people of this country can rely upon the fact that I will be a lender
0	1	there were fourteen people uh - in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia. That's an overwhelming support from my own people who know me best
0	1	"Our general economy, our national economy, our mainstream economy is democratic, is based on incentives, a small ""d"" Al, it's capitalism and incentives for working and saving and investing and producing, and families and the things that really lead to progress up that ladder that we call ""The American Dream,"" but is what is really universal. We really have two economies"
2	0	today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea. otherwise we'll be in deep trouble in the future
2	0	They have done it. Where I part with the President is that
0	1	We think that the protection of job safety in the workplace is very, very important, but what we've said is look, start, start measuring the results.. We believe that there is a new approach
0	1	Mr. Vice President, we were attacked. I would argue we've already been attacked
2	0	"The word ""economics"" in Greek came from the word family, or law or custom of the family. We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges."
2	0	I think that's the test of public service. That's $7 trillion
2	0	This doesn't have to be. One seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies that cost $1.5 trillion
0	1	You voted for the war. you've not been consistent
0	1	They know what it's like not to have family leave or childcare. I do think there are special experiences and judgments and backgrounds and understandings that women bring to this process
2	0	We can lend money but we have to do it wisely. I think that in the aftermath of the Cold War, it's time for us to do something very similar
0	1	we're sitting down and talking to the Soviets about strategic arms. we didn't listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age
0	1	when I'm president, we'll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014. we're going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014
2	0	For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to. Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was
2	0	Two weeks ago, there was a meeting of the North Atlantic Council, which is the political arm of NATO. My biggest disappointment in Washington is how partisan the town is
0	1	to buy a house. I think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the opening up of opportunities - uh to black people
2	0	If we're smart. The HMOs are against the patient's rights bill, the Dingle-Norwood bill that I support
2	0	The Soviet Union, to our surprise -- and not just mine -- made it plain when we brought this up that they placed, they thought, a greater reliance on the land-based missiles and, therefore, they wanted to take up all three. We're going to have to prioritize
2	0	We have not been updating from the new standpoint. there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here
0	1	It's five pages of the leaders, world leaders, that the Soviet leaders have met with, and they're not little people. They're people like Mitterrand of France and Kohl of Germany and President Kiprianou of Cyprus - you go down the list, five pages of people that the Soviet leaders have managed to meet with
2	0	As for saving energy and conserving, the American people haven't been doing badly at that. it's true
2	0	Vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued. You know, in the neighborhood I grew up in, it was all about dignity and respect
2	0	I went to Washington to fix problems. I'm proud of the record
0	1	That's for the uh - proper authorities who have control over those tapes to make that decision. I think the matter is settled once and for all
0	1	because of our character. we always bounce back
2	0	I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues instead of trying to characterize each other's motivations. I've been heavily criticized
0	1	John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound. I do not think that they are
0	1	I think it is manmade. I think it's clearly manmade
0	1	I will not let that happen. It's going to help those families
2	0	Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending. That's got to be changed
2	0	I fully understand the threat. by coming over here, and making investments in this country, we are seeing jobs
2	0	We created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans. Senator Hagel of Nebraska said that the handling of Iraq is beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing
2	0	One is Governor Avell- Averell Harriman, who visited the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people
2	0	I told the NRA that's history. I’m willing to do anything.
0	1	We're not going to suggest to them that things are going well in Iraq or anyplace else when, in fact, they're not. we're going to actually tell the American people the truth
0	1	We have done that. All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done
2	0	those 55 to 65 ought to be able to buy into Medicare for premiums that are reasonable and fair and significantly below what they have to get now. as president, if it took American forces to some degree to coalesce the African Union, I'd be prepared to do it
2	0	we have a plan on the table right now to cut taxes on middle income families with several specific provisions. Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I'm for it
0	1	The governor said that he doesn't think this problem is necessarily caused by people. we disagree on this
2	0	All these specific examples I'm giving tonight -- if you had a business like that, they'd be leading you away and boarding up the doors. Let's give low income parents the same right that people of power and prestige have in America
0	1	Mr. Cruz, who was to be the only viable challenger to Nicaragua, the Sandinistas, to the junta, to Mr. Ortega, went down there and found that the ground rules were so unfair that he couldn't even wage a campaign. One country is devoid of human rights
0	1	They see this administration trying to water down sanctions in Congress for over two years. Let's look at this from the view of the ayatollahs
2	0	Yes, we shouldn't trade arms for hostages. it's time to change the school's structure
0	1	I think we ought to have a patient's bill of rights to take the medical decisions away from the HMOs and give them back to the doctors and nurses. I support a strong national patient's bill of rights
2	0	That story reported several times that I would lower taxes for low and middle-income families and uh - that correction was delivered to the White House and I am sure that the president knows about this uh - correction, but he still insists uh - on repeating an erroneous statement. I've got a different view
0	1	we're a nation of good. we've done
2	0	I do not believe that we have a right to tell other people that -- women they can't control their body. on Medicare, it is not true that everyone knows how to fix it
2	0	It will help you in whatever you're going to do in the next few years. I. too, believe in the voluntary military
2	0	I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity. it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint
0	1	I think we got to stay that way and continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat. I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on earth
0	1	how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country. I'm proud to say we've organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country
0	1	Investing in our environment. I think a targeted tax cut is better for our future
2	0	had some very tough cost controls. it's not enough to leave it up to the local school districts
1	1	earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget. Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks
2	0	General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we’re doing in the Middle East. we do have to maintain the world's strongest defense
2	0	saved jobs throughout America. when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums
2	0	some are accusing us of injecting religion into politics. in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area
0	1	We've actively and aggressively pursued him. we've never let up on Osama bin Laden from day one
2	0	we've developed oil and natural gas. yes, I think it should be expanded
2	0	Nothing has been done.. I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we're determined in this free country of ours to be first - not first if, and not first but, and not first when - but first
2	0	I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?. And there was a long, deathly silence
0	1	One reason family farmers are forced to sell early is because of the death tax. I'm for getting rid of the death tax, completely getting rid of the death tax
1	1	I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldn't work.. This is how I'm going to get it done
2	0	I'll never give a veto to any country over our security. I was upset
0	1	Don't we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America. They can take it anywhere, across state lines
0	1	There's only been uh - a net savings of $4 billion. He hasn't saved $9 billion with his vetoes
1	1	While they were on the ground fighting, they lobbied the Congress to cut their combat pay. He attacks us about the troops
2	0	the stagflation that we were undergoing. you really owe him an apology
2	0	When you're president of the US, you cannot have this pattern of saying well, I'm for it but I'm on the other side of it. we still have a long way to go
2	0	they shouldn't be treated lightly. his policies haven't worked
0	1	Whether or not he's willing to support the forces of freedom and democracy diplomatically there in the area of eastern Europe. I think this is an opportunity for the United States to test President Putin of Russia
2	0	make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary. We don't want to go back to that
0	1	we made clear on Thursday night that we will do that. we will do it aggressively
0	1	they believe it. all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief
2	0	not only is Israel's security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels. It's completely out of control
0	1	if the Arab countries ever again declare an embargo against our nation on oil I would consider that not a military but an economic declaration of war. I would respond instantly and in kind
0	1	If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things. I believe we can do it
0	1	You're not for school choice. you can't be for school choice
2	0	there is no new accountability measures in Vice President Gore's plan. my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts
2	0	They have not been forthcoming. so part of the problem, I think, for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they don't feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks
2	0	Today, 47 million people are on food stamps. Elections having just been held
0	1	High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. I'm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people
2	0	he's got a good health care plan that is detailed. it'll happen
2	0	Joe Biden will not raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year.. which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make
2	0	I think the lesson in Central America, this recent embarrassment in Nicaragua where we are giving instructions for hired assassins, hiring criminals, and the rest -- all of this has strengthened our opponents. With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, there's one individual who's not being considered at all
0	1	everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college
2	0	we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us. John did not
0	1	we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars. pursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last eight years is not going to bring down the deficit
2	0	We've been on a very constructive course in the Middle East, played an unusual, unique role. we can do a better job of homeland security.
2	0	he forgot Poland. I don't think they're right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church
2	0	we're going to be fiscally responsible. I favor it
2	0	for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance. John McCain voted against a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty that every Republican has supported
0	1	we'll kill them. I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists
0	1	because of Matthew Shepard, who was crucified on a split rail fence by bigots. There is pending now in the Congress a national hate crimes law
2	0	This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important. For younger people
0	1	We ought to be working with the African Union to do so. I agree with my opponent that we shouldn't be committing troops
0	1	concentrating on every other country in the world as opposed to the people of our country right here at home, when George Bush took former Secretary of State Baker out of the State Dept and put him in charge of the campaign and made him chief of staff in the White,. Mr. Baker, who's quite a capable man, said that for these last 4 years George Bush was working on the problems of the rest of the world and in the next 4 years he would target America
2	0	Number three, gender equality. I think we have to make the right and responsible choices
1	1	if we find success we'll praise it. when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach, instead of saying oh, this is okay in America just to shuffle poor kids through schools
0	1	It's well-known that I have not been elected Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate nor with the administration. I have opposed the president on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on - on Guantanamo Bay
1	1	We reduced our industrial waste by 11%. Texas is number one in industrial pollution
0	1	I think she'll do a first-class job on that Commission. I think the appeal is, yes, we care
2	0	I don't know of a city in America that doesn't have the kind of problems you're talking about. It's growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before
2	0	the most troops any other country has on the ground is Great Britain, with 8,300. I would say in the latter that the - and that's what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration
2	0	one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident. I want to give power back to the states and back to the people
2	0	I happen to support and believe in the missile, itself. I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what's needed
1	1	I'm opposed to the death penalty. the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute.
2	0	We want to make certain we protect those in the pipeline just as we did back in 1983 and we did it on a bipartisan basis. Well obviously my views are a little different.
0	1	there have been markets shut to us that we haven't stood up and fought for. I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it
2	0	maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years. I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker
2	0	It's a very, very significant piece of legislation. when he said at the convention, ideology doesn't matter, just competence, he was moving away from his own record, from what his passion has been over the years
0	1	She never got a college education. My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank
0	1	For example, in our State of Texas I worked with the legislature, both Republicans and Democrats, to pass a law that said if you come in the top 10% of your high school class, you're automatically admitted to one of our higher institutions of learning, college. as a result, our universities are now more diverse
2	0	I think it's important that we have a position, that we take it. we're going to have to make some adjustments
2	0	it was the right thing to do. I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training
0	1	Congress did not support it and as a matter of fact, just this week, the Congress voted in cut off covert aid to Nicaragua unless and until a request is made and there is evidence of need for it. the Congress approves it again in March
1	1	There's a relatively stable government there now as there is in Kosovo. We took Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks, being told by everyone, I was told by everyone that this would mean that they had been fighting and killing each other for a thousand years, it would never work
1	1	That makes me smart. I think there may be a couple of reasons
2	0	Senator Obama doesn't want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization. Governor Bush is for vouchers
2	0	They make $51,000 combined income, they pay about $3500 in taxes. that's the situation that was left when I got there
0	1	I see jihadists continuing to spread, whether they're rising or just about the same level, hard to precisely measure, but it's clear they're there. They're very strong
0	1	we can send some of the money back to the people who pay the bills. I believe in limited government
2	0	let's help families right away by providing them a tax cut -- a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000. they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami
2	0	it's very difficult. I'm for trigger locks
2	0	I was in a, just before he went to the U.N., I was in a conference call with the -- with the president, with him talking to Bibi for well over an hour, in -- in -- in stark relief and detail of what was going on. I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president
0	1	Create jobs and opportunities. Ours are permanent, ours is a good plan
0	1	And we will do what is best for the American people in tapping into that position and ushering in an agenda that is supportive and cooperative with the president's agenda in that position. Well, our founding fathers were very wise there in allowing through the Constitution much flexibility there in the Office of the Vice President
0	1	we've made agreements, like in Vietnam, uh - that have uh - been revealed later on to our uh - embarrassment. I would quit conducting the decision-making process in secret
0	1	I've been a person who has to set a clear vision and convince people to follow. You've got to have a clear vision
0	1	I agree with him. Mr. Bush talked about values
0	1	I consider it really a waste of time tonight, when you consider the issues that face our country right now. I look on this as history
0	1	in other words, both of 'em serve the same four - four years. the president ought to have a chance to appoint a chairman of the Federal Reserve Board to have a coterminous uh term
0	1	you've done has turned out badly. it's bad experience
1	1	"the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, ""Five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then."". what you want to do to Joe the plumber and millions more like him is have their taxes increased and not be able to realize the American dream of owning their own business"
1	1	I want to fight for you. this is your man
2	0	I just don't want to mandate it and risk putting this - setting the recovery back. And the answer they came up with was this:
2	0	If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts. I wanted a cessation of the violence
2	0	"I favor the present depletion allowance. It's a continuation of, ""Well, there's a strong connection between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein"
0	1	undermined the moral authority of our people and our country in the region. I object to the covert action in Nicaragua
2	0	What we're talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent. it doesn't satisfy them
2	0	Have I made a difference in the Congress that I've served for 12 years? Yes, I have. You don't send troops to war without the body armor that they need
2	0	He doesn't get to vote very often in the Senate. I don't think there's anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt
1	1	in February Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape it's been in in 30 years. we have stagnation
2	0	I agree with the Governor on athletics. I respect the belief about life and when it begins
2	0	I don't agree we ought to have quotas. I don't support that kind of activity
0	1	We need to have accountability. we need to fund Headstart
2	0	Democrats or Republicans, it will be preserved. In his years in the house and Senate, he formed similar bipartisan partnerships
2	0	Weakness, I said earlier, is provocative and clearly, this economy is not performing up to the standards that we would expect from this great nation going into the most exciting global economy the world has ever known. That's unacceptable from our standpoint
0	1	We made uh - diplomatic uh - protests to the Cambodian government through the United Nations. we made every possible overture to the People's Republic of China and through them to the Cambodian Government
0	1	He says, well, he's going to raise the taxes on the rich -- that's what he said -- the top two brackets. he's going to raise your taxes
0	1	a little bit of naivete there. He doesn't understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia
0	1	We're down 35,000 jobs in the private sector. that's what's happened in the last 4 years
2	0	When Joe Biden was vice president. every American family ought to have the right to see a doctor of their own choosing when they need to see a doctor
1	1	a lot of these things stopped in 1994. then came the tax increase
2	0	We're pulling together. It's not good for the country
2	0	What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago. That was our purpose
1	1	I said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that was added in 1983, that's about a billion dollars a year. I don't know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack
2	0	Those are the fuzzy math figures put together by some group that works for the campaign. I think that would destroy the integrity and the strength of NATO
0	1	We have ideas in the Dole-Kemp campaign. we will rescue Medicare as we did Social Security
0	1	you can actually hear the audio of him saying that. it matters
0	1	I don't think we can do that for a few years.. at some point, we want to do that as well
1	1	let me simply say for the record, I did not vote to cut COLAs. Mr. Bush tried to cut their cost of living increase in 1985
0	1	New York is being taxed for money that will then go to Detroit. Detroit is being taxed for money that, let's say, will go to Chicago
2	0	It will go to everybody who pays taxes. You have a lot of it
2	0	We have the right approach for the future. I'm for it
2	0	I believe Palestinians ought to have a state. I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works
2	0	It is believed that probably 70% of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there. running up the biggest deficits in American history
0	1	by the way, I like coal. I'm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal
0	1	Another thing that a farmer is not interested in and that's supply management that the Democratic platform talks about. I think the American farmer rightfully will reject
0	1	we've got to have more help from our friends abroad. I think, will be very helpful in reversing the gold flow which you spoke about
2	0	A two-state solution, building our embassy, also, in Jerusalem, those things that we look forward to being able to accomplish. you can overdo, I'm told, environmental cleaning up
2	0	I don't think that uh - America can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new programs uh - that would add significantly to the federal budget. with regard to Bibi, who's been my friend 39 years, the president has met with Bibi a dozen times
2	0	Health-care costs are on the rise. this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan
0	1	Secondly, as an executive leader. I think that the president operates in a number of different areas
0	1	it's clean. Nuclear power
2	0	it's going to require a new commander in chief to rebuild the military power. Only the United States put the sanctions on alone
0	1	if there were no Communism in the world, we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny. we want to help them
0	1	We don't have to settle for unemployment at a chronically high level. We don't have to settle for what we're going through
2	0	I want to do that in industries. I wasn't misleading when I said he was a threat
0	1	we have it. we'll make it available
0	1	There's legislation before the Congress to do that. Let's eliminate political action committees, the special interest money
2	0	He was a prosecutor. We'll continue to build our alliances
2	0	if we were ready to work and letting Hans Blix do his job and thoroughly go through the inspections. We have to fix our health care system
2	0	He can't come here and tell you that he's left no child behind. The press asked him when the klieg lights are on, said what do you mean by Ross Perot getting a free ride? He says I didn't say that at all.
2	0	This doesn't have to be. I know what it's like in dark times
0	1	We have much to do to step up that war. We have work to do to fight a real war, not a phony war, against drugs
2	0	we're getting closer and closer to victory. we can get the good banks loaning money again
0	1	when we went in, there were three countries: Great Britain, Australia and the United States. That's not a grand coalition
0	1	I believe in this goal and effort with all my heart. I believe that our future as a nation depends upon whether or not we can break down these barriers that have been used to pit group against group, and bring our people together
1	1	the significant difference here on this issue is that Al Gore and I respect and will protect a woman's right to choose. Our opponents will not
0	1	we need to develop our reservoirs of domestic production. in the short-term we need to get after it here in America
2	0	until we're strong here, until we're moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful. you've got to have a government that comes from you again
0	1	I would not relinquish practical control of the Panama Canal Zane any time in the foreseeable future. The United States must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal
2	0	we took 22,000 people out. I do not think we're doing enough
2	0	In the last five pres- vice presidential uh - nominees, uh - incumbents, three of them have become president. I've made some proposals to strengthen the domestic oil industry by more incentive going in to look for, and find, and produce oil; made some incentives in terms of secondary and tertiary production
2	0	we did put an empowerment zone in South Central, Los Angeles. independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney's pledge of not reducing the deficit or -- or -- or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families
2	0	There is a difference with what the president did in Kosovo which I supported and this. she’s been talking about the inner cities for 25 years
0	1	We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits. We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy
2	0	when we know that something has to be done that is in the national interest. it's blocked there
2	0	I applaud the president for working hard to diffuse tensions. it requires a clear vision, a willingness to stand by our friends, and the credibility for people both friend and foe to understand when America says something
2	0	People out there listening know what I believe. he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break
2	0	do we move forward with strength and with prosperity. I'm going to shut that program down
0	1	it could end up having an adverse effect on everybody. we had to take action
1	1	I'm going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort. It's very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when you're busy developing a new one
2	0	you folks at home. It's the age of his ideas that I question
0	1	we had a - a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year. I can't say for sure that we would have fewer federal employees when I go out of office than when I come in
2	0	here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas. They didn't do the planning
1	1	That is not the way you deal with the Soviets. The governor was for a nuclear freeze that would have locked in a thousand Soviet intermediate nuclear force weapons and zero for the West
0	1	that's something that I'm committed to doing as president. We've got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care
0	1	especially caring for our Veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom. we've got to do some nation building here at home
2	0	this administration had been given the amount of funding that it had requested from the Republican Congress. The governor's plan is Social Security minus
0	1	I think we can do it better. my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics
2	0	Your 401K’s will go to hell. Productivity in this country is up
0	1	I will fight until it becomes law. it will be the first bill I send to the Congress
0	1	"that would have been a perfect agreement from the standpoint of the United States in Europe and our security. this administration turned down the ""walk in the woods'' agreement first"
2	0	not just because of Texas, but because this mirrors the national controversy. we have an adversarial relationship between government and business
0	1	The 9/11 Commission has said that's true. there is no connection between Saddam Hussein and the attacks of September 11th -- period
1	1	It hasn't worked. He believes in deregulation in every circumstance
1	1	We need a strong economy. we have weakened our economy
2	0	Senator Obama's tax policies. the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies
2	0	I don't believe that our relative strength is increasing. We proposed and passed a healthy forest bill which was essential to working with -- particularly in Western states -- to make sure that our forests were protected
2	0	The president and I do favor a human rights amendment. we're not in the habit of assigning guilt before there has been proper evidence produced and proof of that guilt
2	0	I make no allegations about that. If you raise the Medicaid to 300 percent, it provides an incentive for small businesses not to provide private insurance to their employees
2	0	that's what I'm fighting for, you. The secretary of state has appeared in the several years that he's been the secretary before eighty different uh - committee hearings in the House and in the Senate
2	0	to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances. We've got to reduce the class size
1	1	Governor Bush has declared to the anti-choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a woman's right to choose. the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court
2	0	the private sector's not going to invest in a company if -- if you're get someone else's. we've got to make sure we're building the energy source of the future
2	0	the rule is that part of their money is supposed to be withheld when they're under investigation. if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close
2	0	I'm afraid that our opponent's response to this is one-sided. The president also unfortunately gave in to the chemical industry
2	0	We had Mosul. There are 4 million people who are waiting in line to get here legally
0	1	You're familiar, I'm sure, with the recognition given in the Air Force to uh - General James. I'm proud of the record
2	0	What he was doing was learning math on television. that's what our trade ambassador our commerce secretary and all the other people in our administration are trying to do
2	0	For three days Portland didn’t do anything.. I hope that from here on you will no longer be saying that particular thing
0	1	it includes everything within the range of taxation. I can assure you that if I'm elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully
2	0	They're the fundamental aspect of America's economy. I propose a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all seniors
2	0	Americans are angry. so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from
0	1	we're meeting our obligation to our veterans. they will continue to do so during the next four years
2	0	It's also interesting to see that one of his campaign managers that's trying to help him with his image was also hired by Noriega to help him with his image in Panama. It has been an abject failure, this administration's policy
0	1	It's completely out of control. the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington
2	0	which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today. just take a look at the positions of the ACLU
2	0	our strategy wasn't just going after bin Laden. that's one of the reasons why it's in our interest
0	1	we said if that's not good enough, there is flexibility, let's talk about the bombers and planes. that's a very important point in terms of negotiation
1	1	The Strategic Arms Reduction Talks were good proposals. it's the Soviets who left the table
2	0	I said we'd refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on 9/11. the military says we need a smaller, leaner Army, we need more special forces
2	0	The last people who need help are 120,000 families for another -- another $500 billion tax cut over the next 10 years. Nuclear power
0	1	We're going to have a good economic package. I promise you the economy is going to get better
2	0	But science, there's a lot -- there's differing opinions. John McCain said there would be enough oil to pay for this
0	1	I love depreciation. which is a wonderful charge
2	0	Will we use our prosperity to enrich not just the few, but all of our families?. Senator Obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights NATO that's in Afghanistan
2	0	You will know their names. I think in the fact that he apologized, that he was reprimanded, uh - does permit him to stay on and continue that kind of leadership that's we so badly need
2	0	it would begin to cut the deficit in half, and we get back to where we were at the end of the 1990s when we balanced the budget and paid down the debt of this country. He failed to take on somebody else, the malpractice suit people, those that bring these lawsuits against -- these frivolous trial lawyers' lawsuits that are running costs of medical care up by $25 billion to $50 billion
2	0	it is essential for us to do everything we can to garner as much support from the other side of the aisle as possible. 8 million Americans being out of work and the 50% unemployment among the youth of our country are acceptable?
2	0	Brady Bill, I agree that it's a timid step in the right direction but it won't fix it. I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home
0	1	How is raising taxes going to help the farmer?. How is raising taxes going to help the consumer in America?
0	1	particularly in these -- these special new groups that can go out there, raise all the money they want, not have to identify themselves, who say the most scurrilous things about the other candidate. it's an abomination
2	0	This was one of the biggest sources of proliferation in the world today in terms of the threat that was represented by that. the Russians are not using Eastern Europe as their own sphere of influence in occupying mo- most of the countries there
1	1	We have not known what we've wanted and we've been out-traded in almost every instance. We've got to be a nation blessed with a defense capability that's efficient, tough, capable, well organized, narrowly focused - fighting capability
0	1	by going after the financing more authoritatively. I have a better plan to be able to fight the war on terror
2	0	So maverick he is not on the important, critical issues that affect people at that kitchen table. My grandfather died a while back
1	1	it's awful hard to say we're going to go out and spend more money when we're trying to get the deficit down. I would cite that as a major accomplishment
0	1	I'm not going to do that as commander-in-chief. I think I'm on the right track
2	0	the best indication about when we can bring our troops home is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility. seems to me a blurring of the line of the separation between church and state
0	1	the only difference between me and any other businessman that has the range of businesses that I have is I haven't had that many lawsuits. that's just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person that's running against them
2	0	When they don't pay their taxes. They have good people and they play constructive roles sometimes, but sometimes they get too much power
2	0	I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people. here's what we can do
0	1	the record is clear. when you talk about Social Security, the people that are going to protect it are the Democrats that brought forth that program
2	0	that's not how a commander in chief operates. I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other
2	0	we're not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in. our challenge right now is the Iranians continue on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons
0	1	we'll go over there and see what you're doing. But let's save the kids of this world from chemical weapons
2	0	reinvest it in new transportation and communications and environmental clean-up systems. Ortega, the commandante who is head of the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, is an avowed Marxist
2	0	A targeted tax cut. I don't believe in command and control out of Washington, D.C.
2	0	inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach.. That's the kind of defense program that uh - Mr. Carter wants
2	0	our real problem here is they both have plans that will not work. I think the governor's instinct is not necessarily bad
1	1	let’s fix what’s broken about it. let’s not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies
2	0	I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about. This is a value an issue that touches my basic values
0	1	They have a VAT tax. Let me give you the example of Mexico
2	0	she knows what it's like to be out there in the marketplace. Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation
2	0	There -- with new technology, with tiny footprints even on land, it is safe to drill and we need to do more of that. I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country
2	0	For a belief that law must be based on a higher law. President Bush has made the decisions
0	1	part of the reason I think it's so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan. I think it's so important for us to reverse course
2	0	I want to take very dollar by which we reduce defense and reinvest it in technologies for the 21st century--in new transportation, in communication, in environmental clean-up technologies. I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing
0	1	"They don't like the use of the word, but may I remind his strong supporters that only last year in the primary, to capture that Democratic nomination, he said, ""I am a progressive liberal Democrat."". I won't support judges like that"
2	0	I'm going to do as president of the United States.. I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined
0	1	That was done purposely. That was more than a mistake
2	0	make a determination of how we can stimulate growth. If you're poor, they pay all of it
0	1	I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund. This goes to our survival
2	0	you skipped Israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations. a national registration of handguns or handgun owners will solve the problem you're talking about
2	0	First time I was there in 2002, it was amazing to me what they were facing. He turned around under political pressure
0	1	"It's only $18 billion."" Do you know that it's tripled in the last five years. I have fought against it my career"
2	0	I do you know, these people laugh about the thousand points of light. the way to make sure our economy grows is not to raise taxes on small-business owners
2	0	not wealthy enough to buy their medicine. I went to college in this great city, and most of my peers felt against the war as I did
0	1	I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country. What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy
2	0	the Soviet Union and the United States can make a mutually beneficial agreement. I think the important thing in picking a vice president probably varies from president to president
0	1	The CBO says we'll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years. If you're re-elected, we'll get to a trillion-dollar debt
2	0	All wealth is created, and all growth is generated by risk-taking entrepreneurs. But are the American people?
2	0	my dad who is in the audience today, he's a schoolteacher, had been for many years. The reality about Iran is that Iran has moved forward with their nuclear weapons program on their watch
2	0	Now you judge for yourselves whether or not that's fair. I’m the guy that brought back the automobile industry.
0	1	education. I agree. Education is key, particularly the future of our economy
0	1	that debt is going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger. military security and economic security go hand in hand
2	0	$700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money. It is a massive country with a massive economy
0	1	I suggested that at least four or five years ago. We have a commission on campaign finance reform
2	0	because of our relations in NATO. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese
2	0	We don't know whether it's going to work or not, but we keep giving the incentives. what you're seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism
0	1	the judgment to know when our national security is not only at risk. where the United States of America can make a difference in preventing genocide
2	0	They had thirty of them. the business can continue to compete
2	0	that I almost resent, Vice President Bush, your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy. He would rather spend the family's $1800 and I would rather the Strunks spend their own money
0	1	He just -- he said, let it go bankrupt, period. I know he had no commitment to the automobile industry
2	0	when you talk about numbers. these were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U.S. competitor
2	0	that means to take care of it. Testing is the cornerstone of reform
2	0	You're talking about Roger Revelle. I have been able to reach across the aisle
0	1	As an aid to enlistment. we had an aid - 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I. Bill of Rights. the fact that, by serving in the military, they could provide for a future college education
1	1	They never got it done. The Democrats promised prescription drug benefits
0	1	When uh - the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent. I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care
0	1	they will show up at the polls. that's what people are seeing now is happening in Afghanistan
1	1	It's illegal right now and has been for years for illegal immigrants to get welfare benefits. I don't think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants
2	0	they were living a sort of convention. We believe that we had also promised that we would make our country more secure.
0	1	We can take them out of Iraq for purposes of training. We should do whatever has to be done to train the Iraqis and to speed up that process
2	0	when we don't ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education. When FDR established Social Security, they didn't call them IOUs
0	1	We have to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much. We have to have nuclear power
2	0	They didn't have the right body armor. Unfortunately, race still determines too much
2	0	He should not be thrown into a category of a 47 percent who don't pay their taxes while he was out there fighting and not having to pay taxes, and somehow not taking responsibility. That's why we don't have full employment today
0	1	you can't have a strong economy without strong communities and strong families. Bob Dole wants to empower the public school districts and the teachers
2	0	This is a mischaracterization of my position. Congress has to help out in reducing this budget deficit as much as the Executive Branch
2	0	I believe that choice is a woman's choice. The coal that the President mentioned - yes, we have it - and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now
0	1	Prime Minister Allawi came here, and he said the terrorists are pouring over the border. I think the president, again, still hasn't shown how he's going to go about it the right way
0	1	They can buy a computer for their kid who's going off to college. which means they're spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers
0	1	I draw the line and don't support a constitutional amendment. I won't actively work for the passage of any of them
2	0	in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh - interview had I do it - had it - I to do it over again. We've got to provide moral support to the Poles and Estonia and Latvia and all of the nations that were former Soviet satellites
0	1	investment tax allowance, capital gains reduction, more on research and development, tax credit for first-time home buyers. some of which have been echoed here tonight
2	0	"When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers,. Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, ""you should borrow money from your parents to go to college,"" you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don't have that option"
0	1	I believe those negotiations should continue. there are certain guidelines that must be followed
2	0	It works. That is not a recipe for growth
2	0	when I used to go home my mother would tell me all I've got is my Social Security, don't touch it. I believe so strongly in the question you asked that I suggested this format tonight
2	0	If we can get it done in the first year. The idea he's part of the Legislative Branch is a bizarre notion invented by Cheney to aggrandize the power of a unitary executive
2	0	we're talking about very complex and difficult issues. Wouldn't that be nice to take $20.7 billion that we're putting into our legal system and put it to preventive health care or women's health care or something else besides trial lawyers?
0	1	I have a plan. all of that can happen
0	1	Nobody has that except a president who has served a long time or a secretary of state. they don't require long experience in foreign policy
0	1	Look at Oakland.. it was more violent than what I’m even seeing now.
2	0	I think it's going in exactly the wrong direction. I do believe in pluralism.
0	1	he would be doing exactly the wrong thing. Senator Kennedy's position and mine completely different on this
0	1	there is another employer that we shouldn't be so concerned about, and these are employers down through the years who have encouraged the illegal entry into this country because they then hire these individuals and hire them at starvation wages and with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country, and the individuals can't complain because of their illegal status. We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free
2	0	we now have people from the Middle East, allegedly, coming across the border. when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige
2	0	They don't name him the most liberal in the United States Senate because he hasn't shown up to many meetings. Senator Dole led the opposition to it
0	1	I guess I rely more on the individual. I want to give power back to the states and back to the people
2	0	Over the long term, in order for us to compete with China, we've also got to make sure, though, that we're taking -- taking care of business here at home. We believe that there is a new approach
0	1	Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous. The world is more dangerous
0	1	if you qualify for Medicaid, and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies.. What I’m going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option — become Bidencare
2	0	If we had the best year in the history of our country for 100 years. The best thing to do is to look at the record uh - of Mr. Ford's Administration and Mr. Nixon's before his
2	0	In fact it makes it less likely for them to come here. the first Civil Rights Act legislation we would send to Congress would be a national ban on racial profiling
0	1	We've had a 25% reduction since the first year I was in office. we're importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago
2	0	if we're going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources.. Not what a commander in chief does when you're trying to lead troops
2	0	Our country is as the Kerner Commission Report suggested a number of years ago was being split, but they said between white and black. Senator Obama's secret that you don't know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenue
0	1	I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that's creating a job right here in America. let's focus on jobs
0	1	the future will call for greater efficiency and greater environmental efficiency. This is a value an issue that touches my basic values
0	1	In what order would you put them in terms of priorities. health care, energy, and entitlement reform
2	0	This is an historic time. I do not want any more trickle down government
0	1	to attempt to save the world. remove the nuclear weapons
2	0	It's not appeasement. I think troubles a lot of people in our country is that the president has just sort of described one kind of mistake
2	0	He voted against it and, obviously, we had to take Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait or it would've threatened the Middle Eastern world supply. We have got to win in Iraq
0	1	He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times. His record in the United States Senate does not match his rhetoric
2	0	In policies that will lift wages and will grow our middle class. You can't keep on holding down the value of your currency
0	1	I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision. I would hope that we would give to women in this country the right to make that decision
0	1	there are some programs that don't work at all. an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel
0	1	where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them?. New York is being taxed for money that will then go to Detroit
2	0	Within that sixty-billion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people. the way you to that position of rnoving away from having to make a decision - armed force or anything else - is by moving toward arms control.
2	0	that's all I'm trying to do, is put it in focus. It's a mistake
2	0	it makes sense. his rhetoric doesn't match his record
0	1	One is the Middle East. there are a number of areas in the world that are of importance to us
2	0	I don't want the federal government making decisions on behalf of everybody. I understand what you have to do to be strong in this situation
1	1	That is not good for America's position in the world, and the world notices. that's undermining our long-term competitiveness
0	1	How in the name of American democracy can we say to eastern Europe that democratic capitalism will work there if we can't make it work in East L.A. or East Harlem or East Palo Alto, California?. Civility, responsibility, racial reconciliation, healing the wounds of our country has to be one of the greatest, most singularly important goals for this country here on the edge of the 21st Century
0	1	We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill. let's keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs
1	1	The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy. what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state
0	1	I've got some points that I want to make here. I still haven't gotten an answer to my question on when you guys are going to start worrying about this country
0	1	allows us to keep Social Security solvent to 2054. Al and I have committed to putting that Social Security surplus in a lockbox, not touching it
1	1	You've got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed. I'm going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker
2	0	It basically protected states from the action of one state to another. I don't think that's the role of the president to pick you're right and you're not right
0	1	said he actually did vote for it before he voted against it. Not what a commander in chief does when you're trying to lead troops
0	1	That was certainly the case from the minute I got there. too many incumbent politicians in Washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform
2	0	I said that our economic plan would produce eight million jobs. They're wholly inaccurate
0	1	that is one thing we would correct under a Dukakis-Bentsen administration. We would put one person in charge in the war against drugs, and we would commit the resources to get that job done
1	1	I’m the guy that brought back the automobile industry.. They gave up on manufacturing.
2	0	when I used to go home my mother would tell me all I've got is my Social Security, don't touch it. after all of those investigations by objective, responsible people
0	1	If Missouri, just given the number of people from Missouri who are in the military over there today, were a country, it would be the third largest country in the coalition, behind Great Britain and the United States. That's not a grand coalition
0	1	I have a record of fighting for fiscal responsibility. We're going to protect Social Security
0	1	under his plan if you work out the numbers Â $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut. I donâ€™t think he will
0	1	I was in New Hampshire. A woman came to me and she said, look, I can't afford insurance for myself or my son
2	0	I’ve said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said. That is wholly wrong, wholly in error,
0	1	they are threatening to kill more Americans. that I think has to be our policy
2	0	That's what I've been critical about the administration for.. If you had a line item veto you could knock out the pork
2	0	But it wasn't just that experience tapped into, it was my connection to the heartland of America. Mr. Ford has just not done it
0	1	The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself. That uh - situation called for me to first put the United States on a steady course and to keep our keel well balanced
0	1	is to give them a chance to defend their country. The best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in Iraq
1	1	the program that he's proposing is not the one that he just described. the parent can go to a tutoring program or another public school or another private school
0	1	to make sure that even as we're producing more coal, we're producing it cleaner and smarter. we made the largest investment in clean coal technology
2	0	We can do it by giving them, as a start, a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice. I can't under any circumstances believe that the - His Holiness, the Pope would agree by signing that agreement that the thirty-five nations have turned over to the Warsaw Pact nations the domination of the - Eastern Europe
0	1	But she is raising your taxes and I’m lowering your taxes. We are going to be thriving again
2	0	the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well. I will tell you how I'm going to pay for anything I promise you, line by line
0	1	You can't do both. You have to choose
0	1	Those are the people who ought to be in jai. I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity
0	1	That's just unacceptable. for Al Gore to keep suggesting that we can't afford to reduce the tax rates across-the-board on the American people and on the formation of the capital necessary to create the new jobs for America is just totally at odds with the experience of both Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy and other times in this century
0	1	I think it's a privacy issue. I believe that a woman owns her body and what she does with it is her own business, period
0	1	The tensions will be ratcheted up. If Iran acquires nuclear weapons, all the other countries will acquire them, too
0	1	it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side. My plan has not only a short-term component, but also a long-term component
2	0	he has broken that pledge repeatedly. I've got a different vision for America
2	0	I want to do something about Social Security. George Bush vetoed the enterprise zone law, the law that included them
2	0	A murderer would come in. I became president at the time that the United States was in a very troubled time
2	0	I apologize to my family. I believe the people who pay the bills ought to get some money back
2	0	We're standing with you strong. It's almost out
2	0	All of these things can be done. I think we have to grab it
0	1	He's not been a maverick on virtually anything that genuinely affects the things that people really talk about around their kitchen table. So maverick he is not on the important, critical issues that affect people at that kitchen table
0	1	his program for example with regard to the Federal Reserve and uh - free money or loose money uh - high - low interest rates. He offers retreads of programs that failed
2	0	the federal spending for education is up. we're on the right side
2	0	I have been in the Congress and I've worked on these issues. the rate of inflation going down
0	1	that's a patriotic act. they're going to be able to compete in a world economy and that makes us stronger
2	0	More than half of these 10 and a half million new jobs are in higher wage areas. This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen.
2	0	I know that we did give back authority and autonomy to the people. those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves
2	0	We will continue to stay on the offense. I've met them in Appleton, Wisconsin.
2	0	by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years. it is now time to pay the fiddler
0	1	The ideas I express are mine. I don't want the implication to be that somehow everything we say is just cooked up and put in our head by somebody else
2	0	a lot of our military are underpaid. it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression
0	1	actually the number I have received 72 cents for every $1 a man receives in a comparable job. fortunately, great advances have been made by women achieving the kind of equality that they were too long denied
2	0	we have made vast improvements in our anti-terrorism. The special Federal commission made good solid recommendations
2	0	we all know that it would've controlled our economy. You cannot lead the war on terror
0	1	this is guy a who, along with others, has taken great risk for great freedom. we need to stand with him
2	0	I will move immediately toward arms control negotiations. That's what we ought to do at the federal level when it comes to grandfathered plants for utilities
1	1	I believe we should increase our strength all over the world. I don't confuse words with strength
2	0	Here's what we're saying: give younger people, when they become Medicare eligible, guaranteed coverage options that you can't be denied, including traditional Medicare. you can't have a strong economy without strong communities and strong families
0	1	six million people are off the taxpaying payrolls because of that tax reform, and they are keeping the tax money there. This administration, and a George Bush administration, will be committed to eradicating poverty
0	1	in the history of the world. person-to-person, person-by-person, unit-by-unit, this is the most powerful and effective military
2	0	you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn't even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable. I don't think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power
2	0	That's number one. We've turned it into a weakness
2	0	It seep into a regional war. The Vice President believes only the right people ought to get tax relief
0	1	There is no question that we face this massive deficit. the chances for long-term, healthy growth are nil
0	1	if they don't, they wind up in prison. it costs more to keep them in prison than it does to send them to Harvard
2	0	we are doing a better job of it. It’s a horrible thing she’s doing
2	0	Doctors practice defensive medicine because of all the frivolous lawsuits that cost our government $28 billion a year. put a lot of pressure on Congress
2	0	I'll call it the economy tax. He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry
2	0	we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria. I told the NRA that's history
1	1	America has to stand with democracy. The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago
0	1	In spite of the economic problems, we're the most respected economy around the world. this country is not coming apart at the seams, for heaven's sakes
2	0	you have all kinds of such clubs on the Hill - and you know that. yes, prayer in school on a voluntary basis worked for many, many years until the Supreme Court ruled differently
2	0	Japan is trying to get the commercial airline business. I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century
2	0	that is to send our young men and women into harm's way. Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh - government uh - plants
2	0	they have been the ones who've been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo. we not only have uh problems at home but we export those problems overseas
0	1	I think the American people want it now. I favor, strongly favor, term limits
0	1	I think we've got to be very careful in balancing the ethics and the science. I made the decision we wouldn't spend any more money beyond the 70 lines, 22 of which are now in action
0	1	Do you know that Senator Obama has voted for -- is proposing $860 billion of new spending now. New spending
0	1	We have written agreements and we have some missiles that have been destroyed. The fact that you have an agreement is one thing
2	0	I have repudiated every time someone's been out of line, whether they've been part of my campaign or not. the president and I will go forward to make the tax cuts permanent
2	0	I think we should go back to Geneva, who's ever elected president, Mr. Nixon or myself, and try once again. free and fair trade is the answer, not protection
0	1	who was released from a Cuban jail. I think of a young man now in this country named Villadaris
2	0	I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened. This needs to be changed
0	1	I know how to do that. we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control
0	1	Ninety percent of the costs are coming out of your pockets. That's not a grand coalition
2	0	He did. I will try to do the same thing
2	0	Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses. The HMOs are against the patient's rights bill, the Dingle-Norwood bill that I support
0	1	Instead of supporting the process, our administration has in Nicaragua been supporting covert activities to keep that revolution going in order to overthrow the Sandinista government. what is being done by this administration is an Americanizing of a regional conflict
0	1	I have been in public service for 24 years. throughout all that time the people I have fought for have been the middle-class families
0	1	What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification. I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life
0	1	I know we can do better. I just believe it's time to change
2	0	then you've seen an administration that came in and really didn't have it's heart in that kind of an enforcement. Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses
2	0	I will pay down the national debt. That is a record of promises made and promises kept
2	0	history records that Joe Biden actually opposed the raid against Osama bin Laden.. That's not wishy-washy
2	0	they have the opportunity to move students out of poorly performing schools to good schools. I don't see our influence growing around the world
0	1	Israel, the president said that -- that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel. this calls into question the president's whole policy in the Middle East
0	1	I think you must have some principles you believe in. I think also that in leadership -- well, I believe that you find people, positions such as I'm in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government.
2	0	they did nothing at all. I think we need much more focus on rural economic development programs
1	1	I want to make sure take-home pay turns around and starts to grow. The president's path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay
1	1	we always bounce back. we've been through tough times
1	1	You can't do that as president. On the one hand, it's a good deal but on the other hand I'd make it better
0	1	this is going to be an important issue. I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record
2	0	The Wyoming wilderness bill, frankly was one of my proudest achievements as a member of Congress. We won the Cold War
2	0	Education is how to make sure we've got a workforce that's productive and competitive. a national law that is pending on this, the Dingle-Norwood bill, a bipartisan bill, is one that I support and that the governor does not
2	0	I went to Washington to fix problems. There's nothing wrong with the theory of it
0	1	you bet we're gonna take a trillion dollars of your own money and let you invest it under safe guidelines. you get a better rate of return on the money than the paltry 2% that the federal government gets for you today
0	1	They stand for a whole different approach to the problems facing this country at home and abroad. That's the importance of party
2	0	it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here. Wall Street firm has indicated that my plan
2	0	Convert from 19th to 21st century capitalism. The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so
2	0	that is a part of being president. I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt - merely funding the debt - which is a burden an the taxpayers
2	0	a goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us - ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be - that we will have total equal opportunity for all people. What he's proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in the Federal debt in the course of the past eight years, an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years, is a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country
0	1	Governor Rockefeller says five per cent. The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent
1	1	He's been in office two years, and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new SALT agreement. Mr. Brezhnev and I met in Vladivostok in December of 1974 for the purpose of trying to take the initial step so we could have a SALT II agreement that would go to l985
2	0	global warming needs to be taken very seriously. Barack Obama did not vote to raise taxes
1	1	because he obviously doesn't want to talk about health insurance or health care, which you address. Did you require family leave in that legislation?
0	1	it will be impossible to bridge the gap without it. What Mr. Gore's plan will do causing huge payroll taxes or major benefit reductions
2	0	I don't know what was right, or what was wrong, or what was done. This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out
2	0	"The word ""economics"" in Greek came from the word family, or law or custom of the family. I also support modernization of our strategic and tactical weaponry"
2	0	think we can make substantial progress and we ought to take advantage. I said I did if administered fairly and justly
2	0	It would blow up the bureaucracy. she talks tough against Russia.
0	1	I'm not going to raise taxes the way Senator Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy. that's really what this campaign is going to be about
2	0	I think they ought to have the same rights. I am adamantly opposed to legalizing drugs
0	1	When George Bush went to Nashville, the employees who lost their jobs asked to meet with. They want to know where they're going to get new jobs when their jobs have been destroyed.
1	1	.I would be a president for all of the people, African-Americans, the inner cities. Devastating what’s happening to our inner cities
2	0	you can tune out these programs you don't want in your house. I and my predecessors - both Democrats and Republicans - have advocated resolving those troubles in those difficult areas of the world peacefully, diplomatically, and through negotiation
0	1	if the situation wasn't corrected it could lead to a national disaster.. Higher salaries for teachers, you added, were important
0	1	"Barack Obama said, ""Big mistake. Hamas will win. You'll legitimize them."". Hamas won"
2	0	John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government. it's getting worse by the day
0	1	we have uninsured people in my state. There is an issue with the uninsured, there sure is
0	1	a very small investment of taxpayer's money - in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh - putting forward of uh - two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the - in the construction industry. Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh - to cooperate with government in matters like housing
2	0	domestic economy is not doing what it can do. Mr. Kissinger has been the president of this country
0	1	our foreign policy in the last few years, uh - the American people, the Congress have been excluded. What we were formerly so proud of - the strength of our country, its uh - moral integrity, the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are, what our Constitution stands for, has been gone
0	1	I would also consider arming the Kurds.. The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq
2	0	not about personal things. The president and I do favor a human rights amendment
0	1	they are underpaid and we know that. We need to reform education
0	1	He fails to point out that uh - in the 1950s we were engaged in the war in Vietnam. our unemployment figure would be considerably less
2	0	we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it.. I have not made it an issue, nor should it be
1	1	that's just not true what he said. you know why he gets that count? The president got $84 from a timber company that owns, and he's counted as a small business
2	0	I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities.. you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker.
2	0	we'll stand by Israel. the $100 billion tax dodge that, in fact, allows people to take their post office box off- shore, avoid taxes
2	0	we have stood on the side of democracy. the focus should be where the problem is, which is the Congress of the United States, and particularly the majority in the Congress
2	0	I talked with them.. Here in the United States, we've made significant progress
2	0	we're going to do it by investing in prevention. My first priority would be to keep this country safe
0	1	the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history - the payroll tax increase for Social Security - which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most. It is actuarially out of balance
2	0	Right here in St. Louis, you've laid off 350 teachers. it includes everything within the range of taxation
2	0	I'm a year ahead of schedule. he went on to cite three issues that their platforms totally ignore: atomic warfare, Presidential Directive 59 notwithstanding
2	0	You know, no one had ever heard of Clarence Gideon, the man without a lawyer. we, in this country, have let our economy go down the drain
0	1	In 1980, President Reagan called you a liberal for voting for Federal gun control. this is something Republicans have used for a long time
0	1	we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace. I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v
0	1	we moved rapidly. I mean, we thought we'd whip more of them going in
2	0	There are two very different issues here. Our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs
2	0	Hawaii does it. Surely we can afford 5% of the $25 trillion that are coming into the treasury to the hard working people that pay the bills
2	0	John mentioned me being wildly liberal. I do believe that we ought to talk plainly to the Hollywood moguls and people who produce this stuff and explain the consequences
0	1	the major - uh thrust has gotta be to put people back to work. Those things would help a great deal with the cities
0	1	I wanted the American people to know that I was willing to give up something. I wanted the American people to know I was willing to give up something
0	1	Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Senator McCain's campaign over the last two or three weeks. This has been their primary focus
0	1	under the law, every taxpayer is allowed, when he sells a house, and buys another house, to get the rollover. I think I've paid too much in the way of taxes
2	0	He raised the 30 years of experience. I'm for doing something both on the supply side and production side and on the consumption side
0	1	We've gotta get this country growing again. That is my passion
2	0	if Mr. Carter alleges that His Holiness by signing that has done it, he is totally inaccurate. That makes them less safe
1	1	if anybody has devoted his life to respecting the role of religion in American life and understands that Americans from the beginning of our history have turned to God for strength and purpose, it's me. We were especially disturbed, Joe, at a recent fundraiser you attended where there was a comedian that got up and criticized George Bush's religion
2	0	we're going to have to make it on the convention forces. we didn't win the two-thirds that was necessary nor to pass that resolution
0	1	We need a president who has the experience. the president has the integrity and the character
2	0	They’ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. anybody that thinks about it cares a great deal
2	0	in tax cuts for the middle class. I would be willing to go ahead with negotiations
2	0	I'll get America and North America energy independent. The vote she's referring to, John McCain voted the exact same way
2	0	It has never been done before. I have no intention of wilting
2	0	we invested in national security. all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy.
0	1	the average citizen out here is just working hard every day. You've got to go to the people
2	0	There's a great young group, Lead or Leave, college students, young people, who don't want us to spend their money. you haven't heard the governor deny these numbers
0	1	We have people getting access to capital. capital would flow out into the economy
0	1	"if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, ""I believe our nation is greater than what we are now."". I believe together we can make great progress"
2	0	With regard to the employer sanctions, we must have that. Antifa is an idea not an organization. . .
2	0	I don't think that we have any reason to believe that the dimensions of this crisis are anywhere near as great as the savings and loan crisis. He has no record on reforming of health care
0	1	he talked a little bit about how we deal with the Soviet Union. George Bush understands that to deal with the Soviet Union and to get progress you must deal from a position of strength
2	0	I supported a big increase in the safe and drug-free schools program. I don't think the surplus is the government's money
0	1	We passed family and medical leave. let's expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force
2	0	"the president said never, never, never would he raise taxes in New Jersey. she said, ""I've got my degree. I can't find a job. I've got three part- time jobs. They're just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment. I can't begin to pay back my student loans"
2	0	That's what we did in Haiti. That conference has met six times.
2	0	I have sat in the homes of many people who've gone through what I get through. we are with a government that's been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator
2	0	Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year. I'd like each person to say did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal
0	1	when we and our allies -- the Italians, the French, and the United Kingdom -- went into Lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the Lebanese Government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government. I don't agree to all of those things
0	1	Builders and community leaders are ready. It will require some funds
0	1	I mentioned Halliburton a few minute ago in connection with the $87 billion. This is relevant
0	1	we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on a world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source. This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future
2	0	I must have been living through a different eight years then the ones the vice president's been living through. It's an issue throughout our society
2	0	we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession. I think that this is uh - an instance of uh - deliberate distortion, and this has occurred also in the question about defense
0	1	Where every eight-year-old can read. Your responsibility is to show up on November the 5th
1	1	o spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all. the other day, Mr. Bush said, â‰¥Well, if we continue with Star War-Star Wars-we have to cut some place
2	0	everybody knew what we were doing. When I became president I used the authority I had in this law to get out from certain federal rules to help states move people to work
2	0	we can create 700,000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030. we've had great success at revenue enforcement
1	1	under my plan all seniors will get prescription drugs under Medicare. I've got a plan on Medicare
2	0	I know how these people think. Americans ought to have it too
1	1	the Soviet Union and the United States can make a mutually beneficial agreement. if we do not and SALT I expires on October three, 1977, you will unleash again an all-out nuclear arms race with the potential of a nuclear holocaust of unbelievable dimensions
2	0	We've also stood up to the new threats of terrorism. When I became president I used the authority I had in this law to get out from certain federal rules to help states move people to work
0	1	She understands that better than almost any American that I know. I'm proud of her
0	1	they are mounting a major effort within their own country.. they are important and dangerous now
0	1	My plan was to have the company go through bankruptcy like 7-Eleven did and Macy's and Condell (ph) Airlines and come out stronger. that's right
0	1	they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever. They're leaving
2	0	I don't think he was misleading when he called Iraq a grave threat in the fall of 2002. I think the governor's instinct is not necessarily bad
1	1	we're getting the job done. Even the administration has admitted they haven't done the training
2	0	I have a plan to have a summit with all of the allies. that's what we're going to do in the next four years
2	0	it wasn't until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said you've got to go to the U.N., that the president finally changed his mind -- his campaign has a word for that -- and went to the United Nations. is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them
0	1	Vice President Cheney has been the most dangerous vice president we've had probably in American history. He should understand that
0	1	I've named judges. I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern
0	1	what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity. that if there's violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control
2	0	We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within.. we think, must come down further
2	0	There is not.. He hasn't done that either
0	1	we should not be imposing these devastating defense cuts. We should always stand up for peace, for democracy, for individual rights
2	0	It's one America, one nation. in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area
2	0	a very small investment of taxpayer's money - in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh - putting forward of uh - two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the - in the construction industry. we are weak
2	0	You're in a country that is heavily populated in the midst of the most dangerous area in the world. I'm proud of her
2	0	He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. Mr. White, it's not trickling down
2	0	The military aspect of the drug problem is being addressed. You may want to focus on scandal
2	0	I certainly hope there is one. We have to make the Russians understand that there are penalties for these this kind of behavior
0	1	they weren't part of the negotiations, and I understand that. yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives
0	1	I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men. I'm not satisfied with what we're doing in the cold war
0	1	"We say ""let's have a vote -- let's have a vote on the middle-class tax cut and let's have a vote on the upper (ph) tax cut; let's go ahead and vote on it."". We want to extend permanently the middle-class tax cut for -- permanently, from the Bush middle-class tax cut"
2	0	If we choose change, it will require us to reach down inside ourselves to find the courage to take a new direction. Seventy percent of my state's money goes to the public schools
0	1	I want to get us on track to a balanced budget. I will not let that happen
2	0	all you've got to do is go down Union Street with me in Wilmington or go to Katie's Restaurant or walk into Home Depot with me where I spend a lot of time and you ask anybody in there whether or not the economic and foreign policy of this administration has made them better off in the last eight years. Barack Obama laid out four basic criteria for any kind of rescue plan here
1	1	He failed to take on somebody else, the malpractice suit people, those that bring these lawsuits against -- these frivolous trial lawyers' lawsuits that are running costs of medical care up by $25 billion to $50 billion. Governor Clinton clicked off the things: You've got to take on insurance companies and bureaucracies
0	1	these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings. It's a criminal enterprise
2	0	it costs more to keep them in prison than it does to send them to Harvard. We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians
0	1	That's a fact. it would have
2	0	The Office of Small Business, under Mr. Kobelinski, has a very massive program trying to help the black community. if you have an elderly parent or grandparent who needs long-term care, then you will get help with that
0	1	He talks about a grand idea: Let's have a summit; we're going to solve the problem in Iraq by holding a summit. what is he going to say to those people that show up at the summit? Join me in the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place
2	0	we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months. In America no one will go without healthcare
2	0	my strategy is broader than that. we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can
0	1	that's been my career in the United States Senate. I know all about poverty and all about need and all about taking care of people
2	0	Mr. Bush said once again I was going to have $150 billion tax increase. I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider;
2	0	You voted to increase taxes 98 times. he says he going to tax the rich to close the tax gap
0	1	not only has he not negotiated one, he's been opposed to every single one that every other president has negotiated, including Eisenhower, including Ford, and including Nixon. since the start of negotiating arms control agreements who have not negotiated an arms control agreement
0	1	We really feel that.. She’s going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court.
0	1	We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit. So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?
0	1	Our enterprise zones, that we hear a lot of lip service about in Congress, would bring jobs into the inner city. There's a good program
2	0	they have no other income. I said I'd do four things; tort reform, education reform, welfare reform and juvenile justice reform
0	1	Be cautious. What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open
2	0	I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street. It's certainly not hiding
0	1	I said, let's fix this system. That's not true
0	1	if we start to take choices away from people and if we drive them into one type care, eliminate fee-for-service altogether or eliminate the fact you can go to your own doctor, you have to go somewhere else. I think we've taken a giant step backward in the United States of America
2	0	I was sure glad to see that I had paid 42 percent of my gross income in taxes. Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat
2	0	Inflation is robbing us. I certainly would not impose any litmus test
1	1	The ideas I express are mine. I make those charts you see on television
0	1	We did it also. show the big oil companies and the OPEC oil-producing countries that we  've got some resources with which we can fight back
0	1	We do have a serious problem in our culture. It's really a matter of culture
2	0	The first thing is the tax relief program that we've proposed, one of the many tax credits for the middle class includes a $500 tax credit for stay-at-home moms just as a way of saying we understand that you are performing a service for our society. I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch
2	0	those very special qualities are vital in a commander in chief. I believe the president broke faith with the American people in the way that he took this nation to war
2	0	We're going to go right back to what we had under Mr. Truman when he had political control of the Federal Reserve Board. if they don't do it, we're gonna ask for tougher authority in the hands of the FTC on the false and deceptive advertising
0	1	I told the American people and I told you I would cut taxes for middle class families. I did
1	1	I think the vice-president's comment about the Carter-Mondale administration really typifies this administration. I'm also tickled by their comments on human rights
0	1	Every parent out there has much less worry that their kids are going to be faced with nuclear holocaust. I think the biggest dividend of making these tough calls is the fact that we are less afraid of nuclear war
0	1	every American family ought to have the right to see a doctor of their own choosing when they need to see a doctor. We are going to provide a standard health insurance package provided by private insurance companies and eliminate the duplication and red tape, and overlap
0	1	They've only approved about 10% of the agenda I've helped to send up there. The fact is for the last few years in the Congress, we've faced a lot of opposition to them
0	1	we've got the largest generation of students in public schools ever. it's the largest number ever this year and they'll break the record next year and every year for ten years running
2	0	in the process, we're going to be saving over the next 10 years another $800 billion. we have to do as the president has done
2	0	That's what she told me her husband understood. I'm very proud of the record of this administration
2	0	if you don't have health insurance, that you'd have a chance to get affordable insurance. so do all of her donors, or most of her donors
0	1	They will expand. It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch
0	1	It's not as big as yours so it doesn't take as long. I don't look at my pension
2	0	We've uh - ignored or excluded the American people and the Congress from participation in the shaping of our foreign policy. if you're a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it's 11 percent tax versus 35 percent
2	0	It's not the right thing to do. I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and some worries on the part of many leaders across the globe
2	0	We had the 10th Mountain Division up in Uzbekistan available. it's gotten worse under President Bush over the course of the last years
2	0	I think everybody knows that. is to give them a chance to defend their country
0	1	eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors. four years ago they campaigned on getting prescription drugs for seniors
2	0	We need to put more of an emphasis on the profession of teaching. it's those kinds of loopholes that necessitate a premium increase under the law that was enacted in 1997, supported by John Kerry
2	0	Modernize our schools. I don't think you can afford to have a man like Saddam Hussein with nuclear weapons in the Middle East
0	1	that will be top of an agenda item, also, under a McCain-Palin administration. Israel is our strongest and best ally in the Middle East
1	1	ever other ad was an attack ad on my health care plan. if you look at the record and the impressions of the American people -- Bob, your network just did a poll, showing that two-thirds of the American people think that Senator McCain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of mine
2	0	even Boeing is losing market share. He voted 98 times to raise taxes
0	1	I've stated on many occasions that the United States must meet its commitment on Berlin. We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin
2	0	We have to work with the police. we don’t have to worry about it
2	0	I don't want the federal government making decisions on behalf of everybody. He voted against it
2	0	“Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. I would say our prestige is not so high
2	0	I think somebody who doesn't want me to be president might have run that ad. These countries can't develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need
2	0	this is just to pay for the additional spending that he's talking about, $7 trillion - $8 trillion before we even get to the deficit we already have. We should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer
2	0	We just have a different philosophy. anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error
0	1	So it seems to me that we can talk about what we call Kenny, the great exaggerator. e just liked to make it sound exager, a little better, made him feel better
0	1	There is a specific measure on the ballot in California. It was embodied in legislation, introduced by Senator Dole, to apply to the whole nation. Mr. Kemp campaigned against it, spoke against it, wrote letters against it, went to California to fight against it, and now has endorsed it. I do not believe that Abraham Lincoln would have adopted Bob Dole's position to end all affirmative action
0	1	I concurred in that, and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on. there was an effort on the part of the president to have a status of forces agreement
2	0	I support a woman's right to choose. that is where my income limit would trigger
0	1	so that people here in Danville, KY decide what is best for their kids. We want to emphasize local control
0	1	so that we can invest in things like research and technology that are the key to a 21st century economy. I've got a different vision for America
0	1	We had ambassadors killed in Sudan and the Lebanon some time ago, a long time ago. Terrorism is very, very difficult to slop
0	1	We have been discouraged. I don't believe the present administration has done that
2	0	It would cost something like a trillion dollars to test and deploy weapons. Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have
2	0	I don't know why -- I've never understood quite why Mr. Perot was so upset it, because one of the guys he used to have working for him, I believe, had foreign accounts. doesn't make sense
0	1	Senator Bob Dole is so qualified. I think our selection uh - of Bob Dole as vice president uh - is based on merit
0	1	There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done. I believe that by the end of the first four years of uh - of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment
0	1	I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class. Middle-income people are going to get a tax break
2	0	it makes sense. The best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in Iraq
2	0	recall when Vice President Bush was running in the primary against President Reagan and he called the program voodoo economics. I know how to lead
2	0	The math simply doesn't work. it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression
2	0	if they find that -- that they can't get the benefits here that they want and they can't -- and they can't find the job they want. we can't do it now
0	1	a lot of the Baathists and Saddam loyalists laid down their arms and disappeared. I mean, we thought we'd whip more of them going in
0	1	That's the liberal philosophy. Their ideas is to raise taxes and spend more money
2	0	even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools. what he is saying there in effect, we're going to have inflation
2	0	it makes me want to kind of hit the wall. we don't have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education
0	1	a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them. we heard Donald talking about what he did to women
0	1	Trump Foundation, small foundation. The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military
0	1	you don't believe we should be there in the first place. I don't see how you can win in Iraq
2	0	When he was campaigning in New Hampshire, he said I am for the pay-or-play health insurance. says it's the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place
0	1	If you're married, you got tax relief. People listening out there know the benefits of the tax cuts we passed
2	0	should I be the president Israel's going to be our friend. We've got to deal with this problem
0	1	Qualifications. I've done the job
0	1	she was extremely angry about it. the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly
2	0	she got caught in a total lie. I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans
0	1	I want to get one with Chile. I want to continue to work after we get this NAFTA agreement ratified this coming year
2	0	the FDA and that's why the surgeon general are looking very carefully to make sure it can be done in a safe way. The first thing we did was to streamline the legal immigration system
2	0	Real interest rates -- the real cost of interest -- will remain very, very high. What we really should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the American people make the most of this future that's out there
2	0	when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal. I should point out here that Senator Kennedy has attacked our foreign policy
0	1	This is the fourth time this has happened -- an identical attack, in the same region, despite warnings -- even public warnings -- from the terrorists. After that, once again, our Embassy was exploded
0	1	our seniors depend on these programs. anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something's going to happen that's going to change their life for the worse
2	0	which uh - assesses every program every year, and eliminates those programs that are obsolete or obsolescent. I think that would be a mistake
0	1	"before he rushes and says, ""You know, before you and President Obama were there. I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades"
2	0	You can't have voluntary testing. I know the value of making sure our troops have the latest technology
2	0	We've been dealing with him. I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest
0	1	help their mothers to become independent and self-sufficient. It's taken months and months and months to get Mr. Bush and the administration to support that legislation
0	1	I'm not going to run up taxes, which will cost this economy jobs. Everybody got tax relief, so that they get out of the recession
0	1	Not one of them are paid for. the president is driving the largest deficits in American history
0	1	Now it's in over 30 countries. you're going to stop them? I don't think so
0	1	I have devoted 24 years of my life to public service. if you entrust me with the presidency
1	1	Nothing could be further from the truth. Governor Romney's right, you are familiar with jobs being shipped overseas
0	1	We have a big program in my state that teaches mothers or fathers to teach their kids to get ready for school. Including the parents in the preschool education of their kids, even if they're poor and uneducated, can make a huge difference
0	1	Bonus plans to keep some of our high-skilled folks in the services and a commander in chief who clearly sets the mission. I want to rebuild the military power
0	1	traveling to some of the places we've talked about tonight. I have a very clear idea of what has to be done to keep this country safe
0	1	there has been the development on our part primarily, the cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched - launched from high-performance aircraft, like the B-52s or the B-1s, which I hope we proceed with; cruise missiles which could be launched from either surface or submarine uh - naval vessels. Those gray-area weapons systems are creating some problems in a - the agreement for a SALT II negotiation
0	1	We're not moving ahead in education the way we should. My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it's also stood still around the world
2	0	We have to obviously cut spending. The bills that I vetoed, the one for an additional $6 billion, was not a bill that would have solved our unemployment problems
0	1	Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done. we do have to hold them responsible
2	0	the result is, we deployed, and the Soviets kept deploying, and then we negotiated from strength. that isn't good enough
2	0	I said then and I believe today that freedom does mean freedom for everybody. You don't send troops to war without the body armor that they need
2	0	The Soviets are modernizing. All of them with little or no health insurance
0	1	this world is more complex and we're being pressed harder all the time. I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training
0	1	Nobody has more respect for women than I do. I have tremendous respect for women
0	1	More people signed up. That didn't happen
1	1	it's not everything. I believe experience counts
2	0	you've got to make a decision. This is dangerous
1	1	Why can’t they do it quietly. we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks
2	0	Asia will be our largest trading partner in the future. we're going to have cost controls to eliminate the unnecessary procedures that are costing so much money today
0	1	"the voucher says, ""Mom, when you're -- when you're 65, go out there, shop for the best insurance you can get. You're out of Medicare."". We will not, though, be part of any voucher plan eliminating"
0	1	the parent can go to a tutoring program or another public school or another private school. the consequence is that federal portion or federal money will go to the parent
1	1	there's one going on right now, which we don't know about it. they're winning
2	0	I'm a product of public schools, my family, wife and daughters all went to public schools. we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure
0	1	Nobody ever gets it. Your targeted tax cut, Mr. President, never hits anybody
2	0	What is more moral than peace, and the United States is at peace today?. that's what I've done my whole career, Gwen, on very, very controversial issues
2	0	we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on a world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source. That's exactly where we find ourselves today
2	0	the percentage gain than it was under — in three years — than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely. the Republican leadership of the House and Senate won't even let us have a vote on it
2	0	I am for licensing by states of new handgun purchases. We learned from their mistakes
2	0	The way you get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. Under Governor Bush's plan, they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an HMO or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage, but there would be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions
2	0	that is the prophecies down through the years, the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of Armageddon, and so forth. But we’ve got to get costs down
0	1	that's where we are now. you have to develop consensus or you can't get anything done
0	1	we cut taxes for everybody. Everybody got tax relief, so that they get out of the recession
2	0	I saw the agreement that Prime Minister Rabin and Yassir Arafat signed on the West Bank. here are the choices that I will make
2	0	they have the opportunity to move students out of poorly performing schools to good schools. we now have people from the Middle East, allegedly, coming across the border
2	0	especially, recently, in Poland. that would be priority number one
0	1	I believe that the purpose of politics is to give people the tools to make the most of their own lives. to reinforce the values of opportunity and responsibility
2	0	I've supported that policy. which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine
2	0	They were already having a tough time. it's a plan that lowers cost for everybody, covers all children
2	0	can work with the Congress. The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward.
2	0	If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again.. These are my commitments
2	0	they are not four years closer to a nuclear weapon. You cannot lead if you send mixed messages
0	1	Growing up in a working class family. I think what I would bring to the office of the vice presidency is a lifetime  's experience
0	1	Barack Obama laid out four basic criteria for any kind of rescue plan here. We're going to focus on the middle class
2	0	Saddam Hussein more important than Osama bin Laden? I don't think so. I've made some proposals to strengthen the domestic oil industry by more incentive going in to look for, and find, and produce oil; made some incentives in terms of secondary and tertiary production
1	1	we can't just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out. it's worse last year than the year before
2	0	do so in a way that's responsible and within the Constitution of the United States. we can do better
2	0	The islands which Mr. Nixon is discussing are five or four miles, respectively, off the coast of China. I favor, strongly favor, term limits
1	1	John has just made up some very interesting figures. I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military
0	1	Even FOX News disputes it, and that doesn't happen very often when it comes to accusations about me. the notion that I voted for a tax increase for people making $42,000 a year has been disputed by everybody who has looked at this claim that Senator McCain keeps on making
2	0	that is exactly what they want to do. I think it's very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign '80 should relate to the economy of the country
0	1	we went there for one reason: to get those people who killed Americans, Al Qaida. That was our purpose
0	1	just today in the Los Angeles Times Clyde Prestowitz, who was one of President Reagan's leading trade advisers and a life-long conservative Republican, endorsed my candidacy because he knows that I'll have a free and fair trade policy, a hard-headed, realistic policy, and not get caught up in rubber-stamping everything the Bush administration did. I am the one who's in the middle on this
0	1	That's not what we are going to do. I'm for the taxpayer bill of rights
0	1	Medicare and Social Security did so much for my own family. We're not going to run away
0	1	we ought to speak out against these violations of civility when they do occur. I think that is a very important message to deliver
0	1	Not one dime. if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax
2	0	we don't provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests. I think the man anybody that gets into this political arena and has to face you guys everyday deserves a word of praise
0	1	that's the best way to secure America. the best way to protect our citizens from guns is to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns
0	1	the Department of Justice is fully enforcing, and enforcing effectively, the Voting Rights Act, the legislation that involves jobs, housing for minorities, not only blacks but all others. I'm proud of the record
2	0	he doubled down. In fact he is on Medicare
0	1	They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years. They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians
1	1	Not true. that's not what you've done in the last four years
2	0	if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. I know the Cuban state as a police state
2	0	so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing. I would be the point person for the legislative initiatives in the United States Congress for our administration
2	0	which leaves the U.S. with 50 percent, not 90 percent. that's what concerns me
0	1	there is a major problem there. we've got to attend to them
1	1	if you look at the record and the impressions of the American people -- Bob, your network just did a poll, showing that two-thirds of the American people think that Senator McCain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of mine. Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history
2	0	People are going back to work; 6 million of them.. we wouldn't use the Russians
0	1	there was still some slight difference there between those two lines. you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted
2	0	I think if we act effectively, if we stabilize the housing market. I think that's the essence of leadership
0	1	Let me point out again that his Congress - the Democratic Congress - has cut eighty million dollars off of the Voice of America appropriations. Senator Kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcasts for Latin America
2	0	The Republican party has produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, and Landon. I think I just heard Mrs. Ferraro say that she would do away with all covert actions
2	0	we will have to maintain an adequate military capability. That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget
2	0	This is the typical type of Clinton response. I know what a hate crime statute pending at the national level is all about in the aftermath of James Byrd's death
0	1	if we fail, the cause of freedom fails. I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business
2	0	to diminish and reduce the likelihood of a commencement of a war and the use of nuclear weapons. in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half - a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent
2	0	they don't feel that uh - they know you or the people around you. all he can talk about-he goes around ranting about Noriega
2	0	They think the only way to do it is for the federal government to do it all. I'm not going to let the United States carry the burden for cleaning up the world's air
2	0	they came after me trying to do a coup.. Governor Carter again contradicts himself
0	1	These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment. When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of
2	0	It works. that's happening
2	0	I was in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat. I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid
2	0	if we can negotiate with the Soviet Union and bring down the level of conventional forces in Europe with deeper cuts in the Soviet side,. I think the Senate was right, including a majority of the Democrats, a majority of the Republicans, when they rejected Senator Kennedy's position in 1955
2	0	We rank first in the country in job growth. He knows all of the little stinky numbers these guys do
2	0	All seniors are covered under prescription drugs in my plan. They're a member of the axis of evil
0	1	"President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, ""We are great, but we can be greater.''. We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children"
2	0	it's covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation. All history tells us that that's a mistake
2	0	we had more votes than he had, then they decided to pull the plug. To involve them in the administration of government and the feeling that they belong to the societal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and in the executive branch is a very important commitment which I am trying to realize and will continue to do so in the future
1	1	we've got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff. the magnitude of the tax cuts that you're talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow
0	1	It's lining out clear objectives and having your friends and your allies ready to back you up there. But diplomacy is hard work by serious people
2	0	They need to know that the credibility of the United States is always good. When the Asian financial crisis raised the risk of world-wide recession that could affect our economy
2	0	I believe in local control of schools. You see all these ads
2	0	There has been a restoration of faith and confidence and trust in the presidency. there is a new spirit in America
0	1	send their kids to college with a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition per child per year. I want to give new choices to parents
0	1	now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own homes. Our housing programs have uh - gone bad
0	1	We have every two years tests that look at how well our kids are doing. that was what allowed us to become the number one state in the nation
0	1	save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare. n the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts.
2	0	farmers are having their worst year. Karl Marx said that the free enterprise system in a democracy can only continue to exist when they are at war or preparing far war
0	1	You're going to have 120 to 150 new members of Congress. if the people really have a mind to change, they can
0	1	I made it plain to them. There's been no change in my attitude at all
2	0	This is a very- -this is a very important issue.. I can't even tell you the circumstances
0	1	we've done. The key to success in Afghanistan has been, again, to go in and go after the terrorists
2	0	Al Gore and I have issued an economic plan in which we've stated specific goals for the future. I think my dad would be pretty proud of me
2	0	We can help build coalitions. I want to make sure people understand that the president is proposing a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage that is completely unnecessary
2	0	Can you really trust Bill Clinton?. this is a family issue
2	0	it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all.. In order to defend ourselves, we'd have to get international approval
2	0	The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes. I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined
2	0	we didn't find out he didn't have weapons until we got there. let's talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment
2	0	Try and get a mortgage these days. The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects
0	1	It was killed in the Rules Committee.. It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives.
2	0	Fortunately, he has been during Democratic as well as Republican administrations. Throughout my career in public service, I have fought for the working men and women of this country, middle-class families
2	0	that's a patriotic act. In fact there are serious problems
1	1	what's really hurting American business more than anything else is the cost of health care. you didn't hear any plan from the president, because he doesn't have a plan to lower the cost of health care
1	1	until we stabilize home values in America, we're never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy. s it expensive? Yes
1	1	I don't see how you can win in Iraq. I don't think my opponent has got the right view about the world to make us safe
0	1	is an absolute disgrace.. I'll do everything I can as president to stop the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries
0	1	We are not investing that surplus like a pension fund. We are spending that surplus to make the deficit look smaller to you than it really is
0	1	have no place else to turn. they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security
0	1	This is America. No discrimination
0	1	We've made real progress there. we've focused on the tactical
2	0	removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying -- with widows trying to get them through college. that doesn't indicate that we're trigger-happy
2	0	she took on a governor who was a member of her own party when she ran for governor. He really didn't have a new economic program until over 1300 days into his presidency
2	0	I think that's what leadership is all about. My judgment is that the program the Vice President put forward, which is an extension of Mr. Benson's program, will cost a billion dollars more than the present program
2	0	I think I just heard Mrs. Ferraro say that she would do away with all covert actions. we were going to make sure that we finished the job
0	1	they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon. we've seen over the last several years is Iran's influence grow
2	0	whenever you uh - uh - in - in - uh - appropriates money for one of these projects, you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while they eventually do pay out,. also domestic exploration yes
1	1	When Senator Dole made that remark about all the elitists, all the young elitists in the administration, one of the young men who works for me who grew up in a house trailer looked at me and said, Mr. President, I know how you grew up, who is he talking about. There will be people with experience and people who understand America and people who've made it and know the hard knocks in life
0	1	Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal
2	0	the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons. let's encourage the Soviets to come to the table as we did at the Gromyko meeting
0	1	We want to get rid of tax cuts for companies sending jobs overseas. We have a plan
2	0	as far as participating in the shaping of uh - concepts and commitments. he did sign it
2	0	It requires taking as much as a trillion dollars out of the Social Security fund. America must be strong
2	0	He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate, super majority in both Houses. She had a small business with 63 employees
0	1	I may have to make those tough decisions. the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nation's security
0	1	We have the strongest military. I'll do whatever is necessary, if I'm president, to make sure that it stays that way
2	0	It's one that we will solve and must solve. I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom
0	1	How long can we continue with trickle-down economics when the record of failure is so abundantly clear?. The experience that George Bush and Dan Quayle have been talking about includes the worst economic performance since the Great Depression
1	1	What I criticized was the failure of the Administration to use its great influence to persuade the Cuban government to hold free elections, particularly in 1957 and 1958. Senator Kennedy also indicated with regard to Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not calling for free elections in that country
0	1	My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here. She had one of the greatest lines of all lines
0	1	I voted against it. this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk
0	1	If you like your health care plan, you can keep it. Look at all the string of broken promises
0	1	they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted. he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women
0	1	n Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because it's so dangerous
2	0	The first President out of thirty-eight that ever resigned from public office under pressure. the focus should be where the problem is, which is the Congress of the United States, and particularly the majority in the Congress
0	1	do some of the things at the federal level in court reform that I've just described, as has been done in Georgia and other states. I would also like to uh - completely revise our criminal justice system
1	1	Certainly, I’m not proud of it. this is locker room talk
0	1	I worry about federalizing education if I were you. One size does not fit all
2	0	I was a prosecutor for almost five years in the district attorney's office in Queens County and I was a teacher.. let's get the record straight
0	1	the president didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he's really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception. you've been bombarded with advertisements suggesting that I've changed a position on this or that or the other
0	1	the Eisenhower Administration has moved. That is the growth that we are looking for;
2	0	he left the senate, we abandoned that. It's obvious that there are certain things that have to be done
2	0	The Natl Women's Political Caucus gave me an award, one of their Good Guy Awards, for my involvement of women in high levels of government. I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side
0	1	all he can talk about-he goes around ranting about Noriega. He can talk about Iran/Contra
2	0	I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention. weâ€™d better get after it, we better start exploring it
0	1	They are overworked and my daughter will tell you. It's not the problem of the teachers
0	1	I said we'd refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on 9/11. we have gone after Al Qaeda's leadership like never before
2	0	I also laid out a very strict series of things we needed to do in order to proceed from a position of strength. It can't do it all
2	0	a low-income housing tax credit. there is a record here
0	1	We do not need 4 more years of an economic theory that doesn't work. You have to decide whether you want to change or not
2	0	building an infrastructure and an economy here in this country for the '90's and the next century. One of the worst things we can do is fail to establish high standards
1	1	I have. somehow I haven't been straightforward
0	1	They want to know where they're going to get new jobs when their jobs have been destroyed.. there are 1.4 million manufacturing jobs that have been lost
2	0	a lot of mutual distrust developed. the president and I will go forward to make the tax cuts permanent
0	1	China and India were exempted from that treaty. I'm not going to let the United States carry the burden for cleaning up the world's air
0	1	Like a lot of people we know at home had a drug problem.. I’m proud of him.
2	0	he cut defense $112 billion. we're not
1	1	The uh - description just made of this administration's record is hard to uh - recognize. the Department of Justice is fully enforcing, and enforcing effectively, the Voting Rights Act, the legislation that involves jobs, housing for minorities, not only blacks but all others
0	1	He voted for nearly a billion dollars in pork barrel earmark projects. New spending
0	1	he's been replaced by Mary Fisher, who electrified the Republican Convention by talking about the compassion and the concern that we feel. I think she'll do a first-class job on that Commission
2	0	he should have been tackling it for the last seven years. I have a record of appointing judges in the State of Texas
0	1	I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help. I believe that that would help in terms of shelter
0	1	Now we have a very, very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics, and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization. I'd say, several hundred of them
2	0	Most of the people around you on a day-to-day basis are the people you've kno- known in Georgia. I was embarrassed by it
0	1	It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want. Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you
0	1	one of the hallmarks of my relationship in Austin, Texas, is that I've had the capacity to work with both Republicans and Democrats. I think that's an important part of leadership
0	1	I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.. we also want our education to be free of federal control.
2	0	That's just not right. I've just defined them
0	1	They left—fired 1,400 people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis
0	1	No. it doesn't speak for itself
2	0	we have our generals lined up, one in particular, that’s the head of logistics.. you get zippo
2	0	I think he's talking about the Reagan-Bush years where we created 15 million jobs. I'm trying to save your Medicare
0	1	I was very pleased that uh - an overwhelming Democratic United States Senate, after going into his background, came to the conclusion that he was uh - fit and should serve, and the vote in his behalf was overwhelming. I selected him
2	0	It's a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans. The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country
2	0	we've got to do a lot better on education. She called it the gold standard
0	1	I love great schools. Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states
0	1	every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States. that is a strategic mistake
2	0	It will require some funds. I promise you that if you give me the extraordinary honor of serving as your president, I will work every single day, tirelessly, on your behalf and on the behalf of the future of our children
1	1	Americans are craving that straight talk and just want to know, hey, if you voted for it, tell us why you voted for it and it was a war resolution. You're one who says, as so many politicians do, I was for it before I was against it or vice- versa
2	0	The guy that served us lunch gave me a letter today. in any event, I understand the problems
0	1	when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors. I didn't attend fundraisers
2	0	Twenty million of you will be dropped. we didn't sit around
1	1	I’ve done more than you’ve done in 47 years, Joe.. You’re the worst president America has ever had.
2	0	the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this. It is for the government to tell them where to live, where to go to school
2	0	I think that is something we have to take seriously. I'm just telling you our state comes together to do what is right
2	0	I mentioned Halliburton a few minute ago in connection with the $87 billion. since the United States remains vulnerable to such external shocks
0	1	The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. we should be able to do that for our country
0	1	That's an example of an unfair burden sharing. although I disagree with Senator McCain about an across-the- board freeze
0	1	It didn't meet my test. I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it
0	1	As a matter of fact, Latin America's economy is almost as big as the economy of China. The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully
2	0	I think the American people will be called upon to uh - uh - be in the forefront in giving leadership to the solution of those problems that must be solved in the Middle East, in southern Africa, and any problems that might arise in the Pacific. it won't be possible to do, if his tax scheme passes
2	0	I've been a person who has to set a clear vision and convince people to follow. we're going to actually tell the American people the truth
0	1	we'll have the moral authority that goes with those efforts. by working with all of the nations in the region -- unlike the policies of this administration and unlike the President said, they have not supported negotiations in that region -- we will be much stronger
0	1	I think marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman. I'm not for gay marriage
2	0	He didn't have weapons of mass destruction. those will be the policies of this administration
2	0	that's not true. right now when we pay $350 -- we borrow $350 billion a year it saps the money markets and the private investors are not getting their share
2	0	Deregulation as a form of political philosophy is a good philosophy. Senator Tsongas a good friend of Senator Gore, Vice President Gore suggested that he was afraid his party was falling into the trap of loving the employee, but hating the employer
0	1	After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. for 30 years, I’ve produced results for people
2	0	We're going to have to prioritize. this is exactly the kind of track record we've seen over the years
2	0	he took a tremendous pounding and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding. I'm different than President Bush
2	0	then to go back there in December, to go throughout Helmand with the Marines, to see what they had accomplished. I think the American people tonight have much to be grateful for
0	1	He needed to be disarmed. we didn't need to rush to war without a plan to win the peace
2	0	what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons. here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas
0	1	That's what Eleanor Holmes Norton wants to do in the District of Columbia and this administration said to D.C., Drop dead. Drop dead. The answer is to say, once again, green-line any area in America that has been red-lined for lack of mortgage money, lack of credit and capital
0	1	that's the way I've conducted myself as Governor of Texas. that's the way I'll conduct myself as President of the United States
2	0	the stature of our people, the meaning of the Constitution, in the future. If there's one thing Africa needs it's technical assistance
0	1	Any time you think you want to legalize drugs, go to a neonatal unit, if you can get in. They are between 100 and 200 percent capacity up and down the East Coast, and the reason is crack babies being born. if anybody can even think about legalizing drugs, they've lost me
0	1	You have to learn from experience that making unilateral cuts in defense system is not the way that you enhance peace. you'd know exactly how to begin
2	0	our wealth growth is going down as a result of it. That's the kind of defense program that uh - Mr. Carter wants
0	1	The embryo had already been destroyed prior to my decision. Those stem- cells lines already existed
2	0	we want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down the level of nuclear armament, will build a more stable and more peaceful world while making choices here at home. Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years
2	0	we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do
2	0	Who has the experience that we trust?. I think what has been hailed as something I'm supposedly, as President, discussing as principle is the recall of just some philosophical discussions with people who are interested in the same things
0	1	here's what we can do. I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad
2	0	I suggested that if the United States felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets. It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned
0	1	They're four years closer toward a nuclear weapon. I think that case speaks for itself
2	0	all- volunteer armed force is not made up of the sons and daughters of the beautiful people. The prices are low
2	0	as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today. what is at stake here in this health care issue is the fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama
0	1	he's going to sock it right to the middle class taxpayer and lower,. when you hear him say we're going to tax only the rich, watch your wallet
2	0	We are once again reliable suppliers. I think he paid about the same percentage as I did in total taxes
0	1	the first voter was a 19-year-old woman. Freedom is on the march
0	1	you have to make it accessible to people in wheelchairs. It's sort of like what Senator Dole did when he sponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act and said to certain stores
0	1	Both of our tickets agree on LIHEAP keeping the low income housing assistance program. We did it also
0	1	We shouldn't do that. That's the kind of Vice President I want
0	1	John McCain and Senator Kennedy and I wrote it, got it passed in the Senate. We don't have a patients' bill of rights because of one man today, the president of the United States
2	0	Cocaine is up 141 percent -- marijuana, cocaine up 166 percent. If the objective body rules on your behalf, the insurance company must follow those rules
2	0	that's how we're going to be more competitive, by making sure our kids are graduating from school and college. I want to get the deficit down by controlling the growth of mandatory spending
0	1	Whenever you've leveled the playing field, they've been able to move. all they're looking for is an even shot
2	0	It's now four years later. I do strongly support the WIC program
0	1	this is that special interest money again. you can't be for school choice
2	0	first time he said something pleasant about this administration. Our policy was not to cut subsidies.
2	0	This is the typical type of Clinton response. the road of George Bush is the road to the future
2	0	The uh - description just made of this administration's record is hard to uh - recognize. won't work
1	1	the president's wrong. He has no record on reforming of health care
0	1	that's not the facts. That's absolutely not true
0	1	I've spent my whole adult life very close to the military. Appreciate the sacrifices their families make
0	1	the Congress failed to act. I am going to announce tomorrow that the Department of Commerce will disclose those companies that have uh - participated in the Arab boycott
2	0	we're not going to change their system. What you need are, when people see problems, they offer solutions to fix those problems
0	1	as the nation's only Arctic state and being the governor of that state. Alaska feels and sees impacts of climate change more so than any other state
2	0	It simply says all these states -- it made it illegal for kids to smoke. they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare's going to run out of money in the 2020s
0	1	If you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for Hispanic, or Black, or Asian. it’s nine times greater
1	1	We ought to be able to build more common ground among those who describe themselves as pro-choice and pro-life in efforts to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies. don't have the government order a woman to do what they think is the right thing to do
0	1	as long as we have seven and a half or eight million people out of work, who are looking for jobs. we'll never control the inflationary spiral
2	0	I do know what affirmative action means. I don't think we need these other systems
0	1	We have a separate and unequal school system in the United States of America. I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbor to do in this country and on this planet
0	1	they're based on prejudice and hatred, which gives rise to crimes that have not just a single victim, but they're intended to stigmatize and dehumanize a whole group of people. I think they're different
2	0	I'm going to institute zero-based budgeting. let's make education our highest priority so that every eight-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old can log onto the Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college
2	0	they think, it’s an estimate.. Bill Clinton, as President, has provided that kind of leadership
2	0	"if we want to talk about Congressman Lewis, who is an American hero, he, unprompted by my campaign, without my campaign's awareness, made a statement that he was troubled with what he was hearing at some of the rallies that your running mate was holding, in which all the Republican reports indicated were shouting, when my name came up, things like ""terrorist"" and ""kill him,"". to become productive citizens again"
2	0	except they didn't ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was.. She doesn’t get it done
0	1	I want to think that they're going to be able to afford an education. I think that that's an important part of being a parent
0	1	they have the opportunity to move students out of poorly performing schools to good schools. I think the most important thing we can do is have a first-class public school system
2	0	You talk about leverage. we've never let up on Osama bin Laden from day one
0	1	I don't want the talents of any American to go to waste.. I think we can do a better job.
2	0	We have had an increase in all of the things that should be decreasing. I am going to continue to defend my record and defend my propositions against what I think are exaggerations
0	1	we're the US. it's not all that gloomy
2	0	Less regulations if we want jobs here. I think fair-minded people that really understand international terror know that it's very hard to guard against
1	1	I believe that's not what the American people want. where he's coming from He has every right to do it
0	1	He says we ought to have gun-free schools. Everybody believes that
1	1	We haven't done that. We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992
2	0	America has not dictated to other nations. There's a good program
2	0	We always had to reform it over the years. I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom
0	1	everybody in San Diego knows we strengthened control of the border. On drugs, I have repeatedly said drugs are wrong and illegal and can kill you
0	1	they shouldn't count. He won't count the sacrifice and the contribution of Iraqi allies
2	0	They used to go in and give somebody a fine if they didn't have a poster on the wall informing employees of their rights. I didn't create this mess
2	0	The quality of the air is cleaner since I've been the president of the United States. The Vice President is complacent, thinks we ought to stick with the status quo, doesn't think we ought to move ahead, thinking things are okay as they are
0	1	which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area. there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts
1	1	the president was handed a $5.6 trillion surplus, ladies and gentlemen. We now have a $2.6 trillion deficit
2	0	I want to get these debts down and these interest rates down. not there to subvert other governments
2	0	quite a reversal from the first time, from the first time when he said he was going to do something?. how does that grab you for increasing housing
2	0	The tax increase I have proposed triggers in at family incomes of $200,000 and above. We have one of the most advanced patient's bill of rights
2	0	because he obviously doesn't want to talk about health insurance or health care, which you address. Government ought to stand on the side of parents
2	0	We have came out of the recession. I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also
2	0	I've said is that we have to store it safely. the point of my first statistics that I gave you - that - that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years - fifty years - by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists have benefited just the rich
2	0	if you enter bilateral talks, they'll be happy to walk away from the table. It needs to be competent
2	0	people are going to have to look at the record. we were going after big corporations
2	0	We'll be implementing a missile-defense system relatively quickly. I had thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits
1	1	incentives for investment in the inner city area, and, yes, enterprise zones. Vice President Quayle said they're important, but George Bush eliminated them from his urban plan
0	1	I am very concerned about it. both of them are very complicated situations
0	1	this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.We are not at war with Islam. Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans?
2	0	What I do is I close corporate loopholes. People ought to be free to choose any arrangement they want
0	1	a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater. there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I've had to comfort families who have lost somebody
0	1	we mean it. it requires a clear vision, a willingness to stand by our friends, and the credibility for people both friend and foe to understand when America says something
0	1	I was governor. I was Governor of Georgia for four years
0	1	I ran the -- the state of Massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years. Well of course they add up
2	0	we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends. the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that we've seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result
2	0	"We must deal with threats before they fully materialize. they talk about this Great Recession if it fell out of the sky, like, ""Oh, my goodness, where did it come from?"""
2	0	that's the good news. Governor Clinton refuses to touch that, simply refuses
0	1	I'm proud of the fact that violent crime is down in the State of Texas. I'm proud of the fact that we hold people accountable
0	1	first let me say with respect to the freeze, that back in the spring of 1982. Mr. Bush was a lot more sympathetic to the freeze than he seems to be today
2	0	Can we send -- can we get Mom's MRI. The prices are low
2	0	it's also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned. We can now impose a no-fly zone
2	0	He believed up until the day he died -- no, it's true, he died last year and just before he died, he co- authored an article which was -- had statements taken completely out of context. I want us to invest in you
0	1	because he has also targeted immigrants, African-Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others. So this is who Donald Trump is
2	0	It's why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had -- had the plan. providing an enormous number of jobs
2	0	I suspect he'll keep those too. the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nation's security
0	1	they want to obscure their own record. they keep trying to attack Halliburton
0	1	we've made great progress from the days when I was young and when this country didn't even know it had a racial problem. I believe in it
0	1	They live all across the country. I might just say I'm from a large family
0	1	he'll have the confidence of people that are in their 30Ï€s and 40Ï€s and more. judge the man on his record not on the-lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name
0	1	95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut. I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself
2	0	I remember the floods that swept our state. we've just got a report that said over the past 13 months, we've created 1.9 million new jobs
0	1	if we're serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts. what I've said is, your first $250,000.00 worth of income, no change
0	1	we're spending too much still. it's not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out - the woman working in some factory being taxed too little. It is that we are continuing to spend too much.
2	0	This is the end of the beginning. I believe we need it
0	1	giving them more credence in the world arena. saying, they've probably been doing the right thing
2	0	I think the press can play a huge roll in making sure that the backgrounds are clearly presented in an objective way. I might just say I'm from a large family
0	1	over the last ten years that's a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period. let me uh - talk about uh - the economic announcements that were made just this past week
2	0	I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life. the price of gasoline was $1.80, $1.86
2	0	over the next ten years it is going to be $25 trillion of revenue that comes into our treasurey and we anticipate spending $21 trillion. And, look, this probably explains the biggest fundamental difference between John McCain and Barack Obama and Sarah Palin and Joe Biden -- Governor Palin and Joe Biden
2	0	I don't trust the Russians. I'm a good steward of the land
0	1	that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity. I do know that we have a choice to make in America
2	0	There's no better antidote to poverty than a good, well-paying job that allows somebody to take care of their own family. I will not agree to any production restrictions -- or agreements, unless we have the ability to verify those agreements
0	1	Al Gore and I were two of the ten Democrats in the Senate who crossed party lines to support President Bush and Secretary Cheney in that war. The Gulf War was a great victory
2	0	I was in New Hampshire. You are the ones who are making car payments and mortgage payments and doing right by your kids
2	0	We're spending about $7 billion. it's nothing short of amazing
0	1	We're seeing Iraq united as Iraqis, tough, hard, but we're seeing them. I do point out that he's been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength
2	0	"It not only liberated - uh black people but it also liberated the whites. I believe it was, their own negotiator, Nitze, came out with a proposal called the ""walk-in-the-woods proposal"" which would have limited the number of nuclear arms in Europe."
0	1	it would have. It would have eliminated the AmeriCorps plan and it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships
2	0	to say that the borders are not as protected as they were prior to September the 11th shows he doesn't know the borders. I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class
2	0	that doesn't cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned. Senator, frankly, you have a record in the Senate that's not very distinguished
2	0	I have disagreed with the Bush administration. the plan he talks about simply won't work
2	0	we've seen 30 consecutive -- 31 consecutive months of job growth. I don't think that we can ignore the role played by guns
2	0	the job is to enforce the law. I am the one who's in the middle on this
0	1	along what he wants to do in terms of corporates, changes in the tax code. it costs about $5 trillion
2	0	With the end of the Soviet Union, the implosion of the empire, that created a vacuum if you will, and made it easier for us to operate there. I certainly think that would be an asset that I could bring to the vice presidency should I be fortunate enough to be elected
2	0	my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished. Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by $716 billion
2	0	to go to a regular doctor's appointment with a family member. We used to have 18
2	0	the counterinsurgency principles could work in Afghanistan. On one of those tapes may be the enemy being right the next time
0	1	I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill. we're on the track on this one
0	1	while leaving 100 million Americans out. $300 billion is really important
2	0	A brilliant proposal to get rid of all of them. Her tax plan is a disaster
2	0	Mr. Nixon has stated the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill. we want to help them
2	0	Other places, no. I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that
0	1	he made a special trip to come back and vote against a cost-of-living increase. I think it's very important that we not see these kinds of end runs by this administration
0	1	we should never hesitate to use military force. I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe
0	1	a lot of smaller ones. the largest number in American history -- not just the big ones you read about
2	0	It's about what the 21st century is going to be like for you. I think we’re going to do well because people are really happy with the job we’ve done.
2	0	Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees,. Americans ought to have it too
2	0	Put together coalitions of Republicans and Democrats. we lose on everything
0	1	we're going to have to buy up these bad loans. it's not enough
2	0	That's what governors do. I think so
0	1	I will know them on a firsthand basis. I will be prepared to do that
2	0	We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. I got rid of the individual mandate
0	1	In the last two years, I have made policy decisions involving - long-range difficulties and policies and made day-to-day judgments not only as president of the United States but as the leader of the free world What is the result of that leadership?. Not a single young American today is fighting or dying on any foreign battlefield
2	0	We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world. John, it's been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending
0	1	we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people. we built up uh - an awareness among the uh - voters of this country, particularly those in whose primaries I entered - thirty of them, nobody's ever done that before - about who I was and what I stood for
0	1	now the problem with completely eliminating it goes back to the wealthiest 1%. so let's do it for most all, but not completely eliminate it for the very top
2	0	he also voted then for an amendment - which was lost, fortunately - an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa. the question really is is the tax cut fair
0	1	we have all these people just up the road in Los Angeles County. what I try to do is to support policies that would respect religion and then help parents inculcate those values to their children
2	0	I don't think we should have a citizenship card today. deal with mandatory minimum sentences
2	0	17 new taxes, spend 1.5 trillion dollars, 50 new bureaucracies. Just tell us the truth
0	1	Paul Bremer said yesterday is they didn't have enough troops to secure the country. We need a fresh start
0	1	even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools. I don't think that we can ignore the role played by guns
1	1	No. You know full well the Caribbean Basin Initiative, you've supported that
0	1	I think we ought to do plastic surgery on a lot of these guys so that they're all ears, too, and listen to you. you've got to have a government that comes from you again
2	0	"It's just a giveaway. The only way they step up is to say, ""Fellas, we're leaving; we've trained you; step up, step up."""
2	0	We want to be stronger. I think it's a very clear contrast.
2	0	I can't do that. This is becoming more troubling by the day
2	0	People don't dare -- medical practitioners, to help somebody along the highway that are hurt. Maybe
0	1	to introduce it on the first day I was inaugurated. my first priority would be to pass a jobs program
2	0	I can't even tell you the circumstances. I believe the people who pay the bills ought to get some money back
2	0	I have a clear record of bipartisanship. The Nixons told this story
2	0	we've beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh - revolution. I don't think he misled you when he said that, you know, anyone who doubted whether the world was better off without Saddam Hussein in power didn't have the judgment to be president
1	1	It's the largest increase in federal government health care ever. he said he's going to have a novel health care plan
2	0	It recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it.. the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful
2	0	That's one of the big disagreements that we have with the President. I'm going to make sure we're taking advantage of our energy resources
0	1	The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida. we still have a long way to go
2	0	Mexican jobs will eventually come to $7.50 an hour, ours will eventually go down to $7.50 an hour. We've got to have no more trickle down
2	0	There isn't. the fact is, let's look at our records, Senator Obama
2	0	you don't believe we should be there in the first place. The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating
0	1	if we trust workers. if we understand the power of the compounding rate of interest
0	1	Our coalition is strong. It will remain strong, so long as I'm the president
2	0	Now we have a chance. that is a tremendous life-saving change which will help people carry on their education
2	0	the way I would accomplish that--was with a tough trade policy, opening up those markets, getting those prices back up to market prices. We are the envy of the world
0	1	a job, a home for all those that'll work and save for it, uh - safety in the streets, uh - health that is a - health care that is affordable. These things can be done
2	0	that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts. now we've got a very good concept called competitive strategies
0	1	As for disagreeing with John McCain and how our administration would work, what do you expect?. A team of mavericks, of course we're not going to agree on 100 percent of everything
2	0	We gave those four tiny Caribbean countries a chance. I've been the governor of a big state
2	0	mean, we've cut defense spending too much in the first place. We've done a lot to reduce the cost of health care
0	1	Colin Powell has said it's true. there is no connection between Saddam Hussein and the attacks of September 11th -- period
2	0	1 out of 6 people in poverty. He won't support freeing local districts from the strings of federal money
2	0	In January of uh - 1975 I submitted to the Congress and to the American people the first comprehensive energy program recommended by any president. These constant suggestions that the basic Social Security System should be changed does call for concern and consternation among the aged of our country
0	1	The threats we face: terrorism, killing terrorists and stopping them before they can do damage to us, making sure that we stop the spread of nuclear weapons. the danger of nuclear weapons getting in the hands of terrorists is one of the greatest threats that America faces
0	1	Now we've got all thousands and thousands of refugees. We're even shipping 3,000 Kurds to Guam
2	0	Sean Hannity said—and he called me the other day—and I spoke to him about it—he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war. It helped lead me through a war
1	1	I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure. He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike
0	1	They were thrown out.. bad things happen in Philadelphia.
2	0	he will raise your taxes. I feel strongly about education
2	0	I promised a new beginning. That's not in my value system
2	0	the problem is that they didn't think these things through properly. I will label China a currency manipulator
2	0	You'd go broke in a hurry. If the president's reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed
0	1	So much work has been done by the people there with the support of this administration. Al Gore has played a critical role in advancing that process over the last eight years
0	1	With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949. We have restored much of our economy
2	0	that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area. we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran
2	0	we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads. We sent it to the Clinton Administration for implementation
2	0	He is a danger. we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years
0	1	I will not agree to anything that we cannot tell every day. I will not agree to any production restrictions -- or agreements, unless we have the ability to verify those agreements
0	1	There was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years. I think that in this 21st century we will soon see the consequences of what's called global warming
0	1	if you look at what we’ve done. I closed it
0	1	People in the highest office of the land must be responsible for decisions they make in life. that's the way I've conducted myself as Governor of Texas
0	1	we don't want another Afghanistan. That's not the right course for us
2	0	he wants you to think I change my mind. People ought to be free to choose any arrangement they want
0	1	we get associated with political assassins and the rest. What we're doing in Nicaragua with this covert war -- which the Congress, including many Republicans, have tried to stop -- is finally end up with a public definition of American power that hurts us
0	1	this is where I have a big difference. my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts
2	0	In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes. You haven't just accepted research, Mr. President
0	1	I'll make sausage. Put those jobs in the inner cities instead of doing diplomatic deals and shipping them to China where prison labor does the work
0	1	There were hunting opportunities, for instance, that haven't previously been available and so forth. it had, at the signing of the bill, both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came togethe
2	0	we have members of unions. What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done it, his last statement, call for an unconditional end of the violence
0	1	It's a great thing for the middle class. it's really not a great thing for the wealthy
2	0	they are our one strategic ally in the area. I think the President genuinely believes that they're better off.
0	1	the Gordian knot needs to be broken in one fell swoop. Bob Dole and Jack Kemp, as soon as we get through this first step of cutting tax rates across the board, are going to repeal the whole code
0	1	A coup broke out in the Philippines. I had to go to the situation room
2	0	When we came into office, why, inflation was 21, 12 1/2 percent interest was wiping out every single American were 21 1/2 percent if you can believe it.. Some schools aren't even safe
2	0	including big oil companies, $4 billion worth. we get a president
0	1	as George Washington, as Abraham Lincoln did. When you're the president of the United States, you have a public trust and you have to keep that public trust
2	0	if push came to shove. I can tell him some I'm against
0	1	we've got global competition. We want businesses to expand
0	1	working on our problems in Southeast Asia - which were still plaguing us. it seemed to me that Mr. Nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need, and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that I took
2	0	I notice that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal. which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate. I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader
0	1	In our time at the frontier of that effort is extending those kinds of rights to gay and lesbian Americans who are citizens of this country and children of the same awesome God just as much as any of the rest of us are. I support
0	1	We're going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables. we are going to have North American energy independence
0	1	When you've got seven and a half, eight million people out of work. when you have it uh - becoming increasingly difficult far a family to put a child through college or to own a home, there's a natural inclination to be turned off
0	1	One of the things we've done is we've taken the -- we're beginning to transform our military. We don't need mass armies anymore
2	0	I have described what has happened in Iran, and we weren't here then either. I haven't heard anything yet
2	0	My campaign chairman, Secretary Jim Baker's wife. Compared to four years ago, we're clearly better off
0	1	I feel strongly that marriage should be between a man and a woman. I think marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman
0	1	That is where I think the future of the world lies. I believe that we have a great interest in the Pacific Basin
2	0	we wouldn't use the Russians. I just don't think that dog will hunt this time
2	0	we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks. I will
2	0	This was a trick on the American people. I think he's a good person
0	1	If you pay taxes, you ought to get tax relief. I don't think that's the role of the president to pick you're right and you're not right
0	1	America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be. we can do a better job of homeland security.
2	0	I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress. we have got to ramp it up and put more attention in that arena
2	0	we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession. we took our eye off Afghanistan
0	1	I wake up every day thinking about how best to protect America. we're doing everything we can to protect America
0	1	It is time for a change. Bill Clinton and I stand for change
0	1	to be able to build on that education by going to college so they can start their careers with a college diploma. That's the access I believe is necessary, is to make sure every child learns to read, write, add and subtract early
0	1	I truly take an oath as a public official to represent all the people in my district, not only the Catholics. I will resign my job
2	0	which, to me, shows a very great insensitivity to giving deprived families a better chance in life. What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh - difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail
2	0	It's mortgaging our children's future. They are shutting down factories right now
0	1	The worldâ€™s coming together. I just think, Jim, that this is an absolutely unique period in world history
2	0	We ought to be talking about issues like health care and jobs and what's happening in Iraq, not using an issue to divide this country in a way that's solely for political purposes. He's been a maverick on some issues, but he has been no maverick on the things that matter to people's lives
0	1	You walk down the street, you get shot. We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because it's so dangerous
2	0	maybe you could understand it a lot better. they don't require long experience in foreign policy
2	0	when you go to put somebody else's son or daughter into war. we should have new accountability, testing of students
2	0	That if you're born in this country to be a mezzo-soprano or a master carpenter or a school teacher, like my daughter, or a professional football quarterback, nothing should be in your way. that is a strategic mistake
2	0	There needs to be more community health clinics where the poor can go get health care. You're 150 -- excuse me, I think it's a little more, about $100 million shy of what you ought to be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here
2	0	You're in a country that is heavily populated in the midst of the most dangerous area in the world. I will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally
0	1	They've held a torch for the world to see -- the torch of freedom and hope and opportunity. it's our turn to take that torch
0	1	they're matters of very deep conviction, as far as many, many people in this country believe. they shouldn't be treated lightly
2	0	You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. He doesn’t want to let me answer
0	1	I signed the Family Leave Act. I'm very proud of it
0	1	I've seen the family values of all these people in America who are out there killing themselves working harder for less in a country that's had the worst economic years in 50 years and the first decline in industrial production ever. I think the President owes it to family values to show that he values America's families
2	0	there's been a moratorium on testing as a result of the fact that we have been negotiating. I believe the effort should be made once more by who's ever elected president of the United States
2	0	I just don't want to mandate it and risk putting this - setting the recovery back. For example, in our State of Texas I worked with the legislature, both Republicans and Democrats, to pass a law that said if you come in the top 10% of your high school class, you're automatically admitted to one of our higher institutions of learning, college
0	1	I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness. something should be done about it
0	1	no American family will ever be taxed on the money they spend for college tuition. We want to provide opportunity for all Americans
0	1	I think this is very important. I will get back to the economic package
0	1	I don't think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better. I think we're going to have to do better
1	1	And such a reckless, reckless comment and untrue comment, again, hurts our cause. Barack Obama had said that all we're doing in Afghanistan is air-raiding villages and killing civilians
0	1	I don't think you have to -- shouldn't have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally. I want our legal system to work better
2	0	If you look at Chicago. we can't afford another four
2	0	This is the kind of policies that ultimately end up undermining our ability to fight the war on terrorism. What we really should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the American people make the most of this future that's out there
2	0	I think we need to put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox. I hope we can come to an agreement because it does not merely involve now the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as atomic powers
0	1	in the mid-'80s, he ran on the basis of cutting most of our major defense programs. It's a consistent pattern over time of always being on the wrong side of defense issues
2	0	It has digressed frequently from important issues into allegations of blunder and brainwashing and fixations on lust and Playboy. I've been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule
0	1	I have voted in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the largest producers. I can assure you that if I'm elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully
2	0	he did not choose to go to war as a last result. I think that there needs to be checks and balances in a democracy
2	0	that's the way I read his remarks. Governor Bush was correct in his assessment and his recommendation
0	1	I'll do everything I can as president to stop the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries. It's not a matter of diplomacy or trade with me.
0	1	It's not just about the differential with respect to women. I think we have a ways to go
2	0	We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people. we're better off than we were four years ago
0	1	He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident. I think the American people have only one - uh requirement - that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely
0	1	independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does. 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut
2	0	Now with regard to the way in which the -- we differ, my friend says that he -- well I guess he accepts Governor Romney's position now. My opponent thinks the government -- the surplus is the government's money
0	1	if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney's proposing. the money has to come from somewhere
0	1	My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education,. I think this would be bad for the country;
2	0	There are thousands of other examples. My five-point plan does it
2	0	he's supposed to be in charge of the facts. I think it cannot work
1	1	Family leave is important enough to be required. You said: we're for it as long as it's voluntary
2	0	That means going with proven, pro- growth policies that we know works to get people back to work. I naturally am aware of it
2	0	when you're running up the taxes like that, you're taxing job creators. I would push very strong to see that we reform the entire situation
0	1	These are two individuals who have been for the war when the headlines were good and against it when their poll ratings were bad. I think the record speaks for itself
0	1	We've got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have guns. We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals
0	1	the administration set it up and pulled the plug on it. We  've had eight years of talk but no action
2	0	This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program. We cut the rate of increase in spending in half
2	0	I do it because we have to solve this problem together. it requires a president who is steadfast and strong and determined
2	0	I agree that we need to cut spending in Congress. this is a critical opportunity for America
2	0	the counterinsurgency principles could work in Afghanistan. then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it
2	0	I'm very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States. The Ford administration does have a very comprehensive program to help uh - our major metropolitan areas
0	1	I had a single mom and my grandparents raised me. I came from very modest means
2	0	I didn't say we had the worst education in the world. I've done the job
0	1	we'll focus on getting the cost of health care down. We'll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state
2	0	India under a free society has been making some progress. that's one of the reasons I worked so hard to try to assist on education
0	1	It's not going to be all done by legislation. I've tried to use the White House as a bully pulpit, speaking out against discrimination
0	1	Capital gains rate, cut it in half, cut it 28 percent to 14 percent. Ours are permanent, ours is a good plan
0	1	you got to have a judicial intervention. It's never quite as simple as the president wants you to believe
2	0	I think we should make it the number one priority to make our schools the best in the world, all of them. They're going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president
2	0	we ought to pay those retirement benefits on the basis of once a year, rather than twice a year. I think that is the wrong choice
2	0	You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. I'm surprised to hear him talk about records
2	0	What is more moral in foreign policy than for the administration to take the lead in the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974 when the United States committed six million metric tons of food - over 60 percent of the food committed for the disadvantaged and underdeveloped nations of the world?. The tax issue
0	1	there must by K-2 diagnostic teaching tools, teacher training money, available. Here is the role of the federal government
2	0	I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions. When you make that judgment, you are deciding not only the future of our nation; in a very profound respect, you're deciding the future of the world
0	1	there would be money and the world would be much more dangerous. if Iraq were to fail, it'd be a haven for terrorists
2	0	a lot of these things stopped in 1994. I also have a much better temperament than she has
0	1	a century that will be of hope and peace. George Bush will lead us to the 21st Century
2	0	I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether. you don't have any impact, except to penalize American companies
2	0	It had everything to do with energy. I vetoed it
2	0	if we continue to spend billions on them, will force us to cut Social Security, to cut Medicare, to cut these basic entitlements to people of very, very modest means. That means that that mission succeeds
0	1	talent from all around the world wants to come here. We all understand what this country has become
2	0	It's on a website. we cannot let America's parents stand alone in this competition that they feel they're in with Hollywood to raise their own kids and give their kids the faith and values they want to give them
2	0	I can give you hundreds of -- you can probably give me 200 cases where one vote made a difference. We won the Cold War
2	0	Like a lot of people we know at home had a drug problem.. This is relevant
2	0	As soon as I became president, I initiated a meeting with the NATO heads of state and met with them in Brussels to discuss how we could improve the re- defense relationship in Western Europe. I'm going to spend some money on the key issues that we've got to work on
2	0	I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn. we will rescue Medicare as we did Social Security
2	0	That's the kind of leadership we've shown. I led the fight for disclosure
0	1	We cut deficit four years in a row for the first time before the Civil War -- I mean, before World War II, and maybe before the Civil War, too. The American people can make up their mind about whether that's a liberal record or a record that's good for America
2	0	I sent up my budget man to the Congress. if push came to shove
0	1	Our position happened to be at the airport. And we were succeeding
2	0	That's the kind of exaggeration I was just talking about. For a return to traditions and values that we once had
2	0	every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. this administration has begun to transform the American military to take it away from being a Cold War force to prepare it to meet the threats of the new generation of tomorrow, of weapons of mass destruction, of ballistic missiles, terrorism, cyber warfare
2	0	We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing. we agreed to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launchers at a ceiling of twenty-four hundred
2	0	you can't control the classroom. It wasn’t booming.
2	0	If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. it is inappropriate for us, just because there's a problem somewhere around the world, to take the sons and daughters of working people
2	0	when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance. That’s why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer.
0	1	it would not be in the best interests of the United States. to indicate in advance how we would respond, to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect
0	1	I just don't think that dog will hunt this time. The American people should make up their own mind
0	1	I think that is something we have to take seriously. when I'm president, I will
0	1	Surely we can afford 5% of the $25 trillion that are coming into the treasury to the hard working people that pay the bills. I think it's the hard-working people of America's money
0	1	In California, we made 37 billion dollars' worth of telecommunications equipment eligible for export for the first time. We've gained manufacturing jobs since I've been President
2	0	I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent. I understand how hard it is
0	1	Barack Obama voted against funding troops there after promising that he would not do so. I know that the other ticket opposed this surge, in fact, even opposed funding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan
0	1	we had more votes than he had, then they decided to pull the plug. Didn't get it done
0	1	We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth. All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.
2	0	I've recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines. It establishes high standards
0	1	that's how we're going to be more competitive, by making sure our kids are graduating from school and college. there are a lot of ways to be competitive
0	1	That's the way things get done. I certainly think that would be an asset that I could bring to the vice presidency should I be fortunate enough to be elected
2	0	We tried six or eight years ago. The tax deduction I talked about earlier. Very exciting deduction for up to $10,000 a year in the cost of a college tuition. A $3,000 tax credit for the cost -- well, actually for a family member who stays home with a parent or grandparent who is ill
0	1	If we can come together, nothing, nothing can stop us. I have devoted a major portion of this campaign to going across this country and looking for opportunities to go to white groups and African-American groups and Latino groups, Asian-American groups and say the same thing
0	1	But I also want to be sure that we don’t leave people behind. That’s why I’m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out
2	0	Will we have equal pay for women, which is going backwards?. They have even -- we learned 2 weeks ago -- taken our tax dollars and subsidized the moving of US factories to foreign countries
2	0	I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high. I'm running to get some things done for America
0	1	The world is more dangerous. I'd have made a better choice
2	0	he allowed this flight to take place while the summit conference - or immediately before the summit conference occurred. it's less likely you'll be harmed in your neighborhood
0	1	I agree with that. I don't think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are
0	1	According to one study that was published a short time ago - the Harvard Business School study - indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today. I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy
0	1	I think some of those charges are missing the point. I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary
0	1	can you make a difference. I have more experience and accomplishments than does the Governor of Massachusetts
0	1	it's not something that we can address in the short term. I think the tax system is unfair
0	1	you don't care about anything but making money. There will be a job-sucking sound going south
0	1	I've listened to both sides, and if they would talk to one another instead of throwing rocks. I think we could get a lot done
2	0	in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq, but for our general demands across the globe. I did not support the war in Iraq
0	1	$65 billion. The budget was more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country
2	0	It's growing a 1.3 percent. I would strongly lead in that area as I have in my state as Governor
0	1	I think it's not just an economic issue. I think it's a moral issue
0	1	you can't trade arms for hostages. the one thing we ought to know by now is that you can't go out and make secret deals with the Ayatollah
0	1	We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest. the most stringent of safety requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible
2	0	there was fortunately others beside myself who believed that we ought to take action. that is the current campaign financing system
0	1	I think that trade is an important issue. we need to have smart, fair trade deals
2	0	And we have not got to allow the partisanship that has really been entrenched in Washington, D.C., no matter who's been in charge. I was embarrassed by it
0	1	with a chance for our synthetic fuels program, solar power. this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends
2	0	We found that the inspectors were being rewarded on the basis of how many fines they issued. legal residence, for voting, is very different
0	1	Instead of a high unemployment, we have the lowest African-American and Latin American unemployment rates in history and 22 million new jobs. I want to continue the prosperity and make sure that it enriches not just a few but all of our families
0	1	We'll do whatever is necessary to be safe. I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists
2	0	The way we work together in this campaign is one sample. in my judgment it was a proper action
2	0	providing the equipment and training that they need. Mitt Romney and I want to earn your support
2	0	when the president announced the surge, you'll remember, Martha, he said the surge will be out by the end of the summer. Go out and take a look at St. Louis at some of that effor
0	1	how are we going to do that. to change the culture of violence that we have
0	1	we've added a million more children to the ranks of the insured through the Medicaid program. add another million children to the insured ranks through the Medicaid program
1	1	No, we're not. you're telling the enemy everything you want to do
2	0	I think you got to look at the integrity and the honor of the people that are being lobbied and those that are lobbyists. I have disagreed with the Bush administration
0	1	These have been priorities of mine since I got to the Senate. I've focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal
2	0	Bill Clinton and I agree with so many military experts. We've got to pay it off and build money to renew it- -spend money to renew it
0	1	That's a place where we can use our generosity to influence in a positive way, influence nations. I believe we ought to have foreign aid
2	0	You asked about promises. When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country
0	1	Strong families need a strong economy. I think what really matters is what we can do to build strong families
2	0	The 9/11 Commission has said it. The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns
0	1	it would be a federal law preventing that. What it says is that gays and lesbians can't be fired from their job because they're gay or lesbian
2	0	in industry today, we're producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973. maybe it's better just to get together and sit down and talk
2	0	It's also important, as we go forward in the next term. I am part of an administration that has the finest record on diversity
2	0	In the winter, it goes down. the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it
0	1	we're going to have to do more than just going after leaders and -- and killing bad guys, important as that is. We're also going to have to have a farm more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism
0	1	the government sanctioning the takeover of that embassy by those students. the government negotiating with the United States government for their release
0	1	this president has been strong. I think we're very close to getting that job done
0	1	It's a culture that somewhere along the line we've begun to disrespect life. It's really a matter of culture
0	1	That bill pays for these urban enterprise zones by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more. that's why he wants to veto it, just like he vetoed an earlier bill this year
2	0	We have to work with Nigeria. If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government
2	0	because of the uh - problems that came out of our involvement in Vietnam. I've met them in Appleton, Wisconsin.
0	1	All of those are legally deductions. I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there
2	0	I know that John McCain has been opposed to extending the arms control regime in the world. I've got a policy for the future and agenda for the future
0	1	I went down, on the instructions of the president, to speak to the commandants in El Salvador and told them that they had to move with Mr. Magana, then the president of El Salvador, to respect human rights. They have done that
0	1	Our tax structure is a disgrace. This doesn't have to be
2	0	You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators. We've got to collect the taxes to do it
0	1	I know one thing about the position of president, it's the only position in our Constitution that is filled by an individual who is given the responsibility to fight not just for one state or one district or the well-connected or wealthy, but to fight for all of the people, including especially those who most need somebody who will stand up and take on whatever powerful forces might stand in the way. they do have undue influence in Washington, D.C. and it makes a difference if you have a president who will fight for you
2	0	on the three most important challenges facing America, arms control and national security, jobs and education and budget deficit. there will be increased hires
0	1	we're talking about very complex and difficult issues. Medicare, it's going to be a little tougher
2	0	maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.. His leading advisor on this plan actually said that would be okay, because then the Social Security Trust Fund could start borrowing
2	0	with respect to DOMA and the marriage laws, the states have always been able to manage those laws. we're moving troops out of Korea and replacing them with more effective weapons
0	1	Stop some of this senseless litigation and let people work in America. I think that's that's the thrust we will make
2	0	That's why I'm so strong for accountability. I don't believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered
2	0	they increasingly are doing. Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit
0	1	we have eighty-eight million people working in America today - the most in the history of the country. The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts
2	0	Senator's - Kennedy's statement that he's just made is not going to help our Gallup Polls abroad and it isn't going to help our prestige either. you wouldn't take such a sketchy deal and neither should you, the American people
0	1	stimulate investment and savings. I think it was the correct decision to do
0	1	to stop all air flights - commercial air flights - to any nation involved in terrorism or the hijacking of air planes, or the harboring of hijackers. These are a few of the things to which our nation is committed
2	0	if we have a good balanced approach. it was a lame attempt at a joke and yours was a lame attempt at a joke, too, I guess
0	1	He listens to them. Who's he gonna listen to -- us or the folks running up and down the aisles with money, the lobbyists, the PAC money
2	0	going to a Buddhist temple and then claiming it wasn't a fundraiser isn't my view of responsibility. If I become president, I'll get America working again
0	1	discovers 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts have failed because he didn't know that most Soviet missiles were on land. these are things a President must know to command
2	0	Democrats and Republicans alike, I think, acknowledge his expertise there. The treaty does not include these two islands
2	0	If you look at New York where it’s going up. Inflation is robbing us
2	0	It didn't happen. We tried this with Hitler
2	0	The world is more dangerous. I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East
0	1	because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she's gotten. my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished
2	0	I want you to have your own asset that you can call your own. No discrimination in America
0	1	We've had free and fair elections. that is not the way our democracy works
2	0	They risk their lives every day to take care of us.. The figures that the President has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there
0	1	They've got people allowed to go into churches now and political meetings without any showing of potential criminal activity or otherwise. People's rights have been abused
2	0	I think he's talking about the Reagan-Bush years where we created 15 million jobs. the polls to me are interesting, but they don't determine, you know, my hopes or - or my despair
2	0	That's one of the reasons I've worked so hard to bring better health care to the people. That's not a grand coalition
0	1	They taught me that this was the greatest country in the world. I'm in public service
0	1	Indeed, the Secretary of Treasury under John F. Kennedy and the Deputy Secretary of Treasury under John F. Kennedy endorsed Bob Dole's plan to cut rates, cut the Capital Gains Tax, balance the budget, provide a $500 tax credit. the plan should be to lift the economy, to get more revenues
0	1	I have made recommendations on that and I have discussed them previously and I will spell them out further in the campaign. To combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very areas to which you refer - the so-called depressed areas
0	1	He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns. there's no way we can know whether any of that is true
2	0	I'll get him. I think that our program does a better job than his.
1	1	I am questioning his judgment on these matters. when he said at the convention, ideology doesn't matter, just competence, he was moving away from his own record, from what his passion has been over the years
0	1	when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences. in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers
0	1	It's precisely what Kim Jong Il wants. I can't tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea
0	1	I believe that it's in our interest and in the interest of Israel and Iran, and Saudi Arabia, for the United States to sell arms to those countries. It's for their security as well as ours
2	0	No negative effect.. this has been a tough campaign
0	1	We want accountability. We think we know how to do it
0	1	It's strength. understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need
0	1	whether it's diabetes or cancer, they come to hospitals later and it costs America more. we also have people sicker
0	1	the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority. If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there's no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world
0	1	he tried that in 1985. I think he's going to try it again
2	0	we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue. we do need to expand domestic production
2	0	I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we're wrong. My five-point plan does it
0	1	That's how it works. We are never going to fix it by the parties
0	1	had some very tough cost controls. put a lot of pressure on Congress
2	0	I am suggesting the way to work out of poverty is through real opportunity. I think the Vice President and I are in general agreement on what we have to do
2	0	They showed up in Afghanistan when they were there. Our policy was not to cut subsidies.
0	1	I think we have to invest in education, protecting the environment, health care, a prescription drug benefit that goes to all seniors, not just to the poor, under Medicare, not relying on HMOs and insurance companies. I think we have to make the right and responsible choices
2	0	we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas - if they make a million dollars in profits overseas - they don't have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country. I think that we're on the right track
2	0	All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion. I think it's a triumph
1	1	We can’t do it. everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country.
2	0	The 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums was the direct result of a statute adopted in 1997. There's chaos in Iraq
2	0	you have to do it in a way that passes the test, that passes the global test where your countrymen, your people understand fully why you're doing what you're doing and you can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons. You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt
2	0	I have seen four wars in my lifetime. number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we can't continue to do nation building in these regions
2	0	"Because in this critical year - period of the sixties we've got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management. The mistake that was made was making the ""read my lips"" promise in the first place just to get elected"
2	0	if all Americans are getting opportunity, we're all going to be better off. We're one of the first states that said you can sue an HMO for denying you proper coverage
2	0	Real interest rates -- the real cost of interest -- will remain very, very high. That's not my plan
0	1	she was fiercely independent. She worked her way up
2	0	I'm a son of Detroit. I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan
0	1	Georgia and Ukraine are both major gateways of energy into Europe. energy is going to be a big, big factor
0	1	anything other than a -- a -- a solution to this, which says -- which stops this -- this nuclear folly of theirs, is unacceptable to America. We need to increase pressure time, and time again on Iran
0	1	then you've seen an administration that came in and really didn't have it's heart in that kind of an enforcement. that's why it's important that you have people that truly believe and trying to represent the working men and women of America
0	1	I hope that he'll be out of office very shortly.. we should do everything we can to see that the will of the Serbian people expressed in this extraordinary election is done
0	1	the president who called himself a uniter, not a divider, is now presiding over the most divided America in the recent memory of our country. We have to change that
2	0	a lot of good people disagree on the issue. All those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is -- is channeled and -- and they have an opportunity to succeed.
0	1	I started with a $1 million loan. I think I did a much better job
0	1	Communist espionage goes on all the time. the United States can't afford to have a es- an es - a espionage lack or should we s- uh - lag - or should I say uh - an intelligence lag - any more than we can afford to have a missile lag
2	0	It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds. there's going to be a consequence should I be the president
2	0	what will help us build a community where everybody's got a role to play and a place at the table. we take some programs that we are doing to keep, like Medicaid, which is a program for the poor; we'll take that healthcare program for the poor and we give it to the states to run
2	0	If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin - which we may in the spring, or in the winter - it's important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we're building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we're determined to protect our commitment. I have not spent the last quarter century in pursuit of personal wealth
1	1	This election is about the future of our country. it is appalling to me that with 10 million Americans out work, with the rest working harder for less money than they did 4 years ago, with the loss of 1.4 million manufacturing jobs in our nation, with the health care crisis, a crisis of crime and drugs and AIDS, substandard education, that George Bush would constantly try to level personal attacks at his opponent
