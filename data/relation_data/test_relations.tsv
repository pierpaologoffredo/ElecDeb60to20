__label__Support	when you talk about Barack's plan to tax increase affecting only those making $250,000 a year or more, you're forgetting the millions of small businesses that are going to fit into that category	they're going to be the ones paying higher taxes thus resulting in fewer jobs being created and less productivity

__label__Attack	How much longer will it take, Dan, for trickle down economics to work, in your theory?	you all still support trickle-down to the very last drop
__label__noRel	to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source of energy in the future	that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or to have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations
__label__noRel	I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama	There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up
__label__noRel	In 1955, Mr. Dulles at a press conference said: "The treaty that we have with the Republic of China excludes Quemoy and Matsu from the treaty area	I believe that we should meet our commitments

__label__noRel	I hate drugs	I've been working on this for a long, long time
__label__Support	These two islands are in the area of freedom	We should not uh - force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists
__label__noRel	He has been watching ads of Senator McCain's	Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses
__label__Support	Within that sixty-billion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people	as a matter of fact there is
__label__Attack	I have worked so hard out here to help turn this economy around	That's not true
__label__Support	Not on their defending some minority opinion on the right or the left	I support that
__label__noRel	we didn't think Halliburton should have a no-bid contract	Saddam Hussein had no weapons
__label__noRel	you demean the sacrifice of our allies when you say it's the wrong war, wrong place, wrong time, and oh, by the way, send troops	you don't have any impact, except to penalize American companies
__label__noRel	Anybody who says America's been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling around America	It's going to cost more money
__label__noRel	they shoot people	They would have won an appeal
__label__Support	first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa	once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return
__label__noRel	I'm going to explain tonight how we're going to do all this and remain fiscally responsible	we want to do is to change that
__label__Support	You must understand the region	It's much more complex
__label__Support	we are asked by the various parties, either one nation against another or individuals within a nation	United States will take the leadership and try to resolve the differences
__label__Support	They know the charges are false	they keep mentioning Halliburton
__label__Support	We've got laws	We're tough
__label__noRel	The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 21\1/2\-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo	we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features
__label__noRel	We learned our lesson again in Korea	I don't think it's possible for Mr. Nixon to state the record in distortion of the facts with more precision than he just did
__label__Support	If we do that we start a chain reaction	I am against it
__label__Support	Mine does not grow the government	I think I have the best plan of the 3 of us up here to do something about it
__label__noRel	that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary	I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us
__label__Support	if guilt is established	we're not in the habit of assigning guilt before there has been proper evidence produced and proof of that guilt
__label__Support	United States will take the leadership and try to resolve the differences	This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out
__label__noRel	I believe the answer is, I'm going to win it	it does not invest, have government invest
__label__Support	which they have used from time to time	we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe
__label__noRel	I know that the only way he can win is to make everybody believe the economy's worse than it is	I believe we can get it done now, whereas we didn't in the past
__label__noRel	I'm going to institute zero-based budgeting	these projections have been very carefully made
__label__Support	We took the Senate report, of course	John has just made up some very interesting figures
__label__noRel	These islands are a few miles - five or six miles - off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa	I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point
__label__Support	I've been vice president for 4 years	Senator Gore referred to us being elected to the Congress together in 1976
__label__noRel	We don't have a comprehensive understandable foreign policy that deals with world problems or even regional problems	If we had not taken our initiative, it's very, very possible that uh - the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh - southern Africa
__label__noRel	I've done it	John doesn't quite realize - he's never held an executive position of that kind
__label__noRel	We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it's attacked	the United States uh - has on occasion attempted uh - mostly in the middle fifties, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to pull his troops back to Formosa
__label__Support	I get attacked so many times on these questions	I don't want to respond in kind to all these things
__label__Support	That wasn't done	we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over
__label__Support	in the sense that we can work to help Mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problems we help our farmers at the same time	I don't think there's anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt
__label__Support	It's against my political interest to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time	I've done that
__label__Support	In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite	It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns
__label__Support	whoever is guilty we will treat with that situation then	we're not in the habit of assigning guilt before there has been proper evidence produced and proof of that guilt
__label__Support	I refer, for example, to distressed areas	we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth
__label__Support	the "Los Angeles Times" spent a lot of ink going into that	There was a recent investigation of the number in Texas who got -- who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records
__label__noRel	That will strengthen us and weaken them when it comes to issues like Georgia.	Do you think that Russia under Vladimir Putin is an evil empire
__label__noRel	You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes	I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself
__label__noRel	Our most important ally in the war on terror, in Iraq specifically, is Prime Minister Allawi	If this report that we've read about today is true, and if Vice President Cheney ordered it and asked about this, do you think that, in the future, that your administration or the Bush administration would have sufficient and accurate enough intelligence to be able to make decisions about where to go next?
__label__Support	At some time during these next 4 years there is going to be a crisis	it will happen
__label__noRel	Harry Truman, it's worth remembering, assumed the presidency when Franklin Roosevelt died here in Georgia	our discussion this evening will be about what kind of nation we want to be 4 years from now
__label__Attack	I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them	Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare
__label__Support	his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it	a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past
__label__Support	The reality about Iran is that Iran has moved forward with their nuclear weapons program on their watch	John Kerry and I believe we need to strengthen the sanctions on Iraq
__label__Support	I respect everything that the president has said and certainly respect his faith	I think it's important and I share it
__label__Support	if you want to be protected	you ought to vote for Bob Dole
__label__noRel	Congress -- they're all good people	We can do better than that
__label__noRel	there's some bad things going on	I want to get on to defeating ISIS
__label__noRel	I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver.	I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983
__label__noRel	we ought to do it in a bipartisan way	I want to get on to creating jobs
__label__Attack	John has just made up some very interesting figures	I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military
__label__noRel	I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns	I'm sure every state in the union has got them
__label__Support	In addition we uh - in the federal government make available to uh - cities about uh - three billion three hundred million dollars in what we call community development	we will really do a first-class job in helping uh - the communities throughout the country
__label__noRel	my change had come earlier than that	And they don't want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens.
__label__Support	If the American people want to do it and not talk about it	I'm one person they ought to consider
__label__Support	He is wrong	In St. Louis, Missouri, in June of this year, Bill Clinton said this: "America is the mockery of the world."
__label__noRel	Bio-degradable plastics-plastic-gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products	I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged
__label__noRel	We have gangs roaming the street	now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street
__label__noRel	It's against my political interest to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time	he's an incumbent, and we've got to look at all the facts
__label__Support	to this day, not one of its decisions or rulings has ever been challenged	I think some of those charges are missing the point
__label__Support	you must provide a strong alternative	It's much more complex
__label__Attack	He didn't succeed and I signed it and I'm glad I did	He tried to keep it from coming to my desk
__label__Support	we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth	it's for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need
__label__noRel	there are things we can do	whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York
__label__Support	We need to battle them overseas	we don't have to battle them here at home
__label__noRel	this is a very difficult situation	off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge
__label__noRel	if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world	so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively
__label__noRel	We need to stand for human rights	which is mobile and thus less vulnerable
__label__noRel	Getting things done in three months that my competitors took 18 months to do	we will have so many people who are qualified for the top job that it will be terrific
__label__noRel	Senator Dole, you voted against the crime bill that had the death penalty for drug kingpins in it	You add all the states that've used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals
__label__noRel	If you're a Christian, Jew or Muslim, you're equally an American	That's the access I believe is necessary, is to make sure every child learns to read, write, add and subtract early
__label__Support	n Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st	We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because it's so dangerous
__label__noRel	One thing that Americans do at this time, also, though, is let's commit ourselves just every day American people, Joe Six Pack, hockey moms across the nation	So deregulation was the promise
__label__noRel	It is believed that probably 70% of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there	because Government regulations and permits, and so forth, take - make it take - more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe
__label__noRel	It would far surpass the numbers you mentioned	Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent
__label__Support	they shouldn't count	He won't count the sacrifice and the contribution of Iraqi allies
__label__Attack	We settled the suit with zero—with no admission of guilt	he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior
__label__noRel	Saddam Hussein was a threat that needed to be addressed directly	contrary to what everyone in America sees on their television every day
__label__Support	I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war	no President wants war
__label__Support	it would've interfered with our energy independence program	I vetoed the strip-mining bill
__label__noRel	under these circumstances, I, therefore, strongly urge and I will strongly hold	It's going to be a test of our nerve and will
__label__noRel	They had known each other before	But he was the minority
__label__Attack	it is just not true that I haven't met with the Black Congressional Caucus	This is a president who hasn't met with the Black Congressional Caucus
__label__Support	Too many people have been left behind	It's not good enough
__label__noRel	It's not	They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago
__label__Attack	get out of the way and let the private sector and our families grow and thrive and prosper	An increased tax formula that Barack Obama is proposing in addition to nearly a trillion dollars in new spending that he's proposing is the backwards way of trying to grow our economy.
__label__noRel	It has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people	If I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment
__label__Support	Democrats and Republicans said Bob Dole's word is good	I keep my word
__label__noRel	I think it was a terrible thing to say	I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt
__label__noRel	we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system	I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are
__label__noRel	which will delineate the issues and which will prepare the way for the heads of state to meet and make some progress	No
__label__Support	But he was the minority	That qualifies you for being president of the US.
__label__noRel	I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do	I oppose supply management and production controls
__label__noRel	the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people	It brought the crime rate way down
__label__noRel	contributing to stability	which is mobile and thus less vulnerable
__label__Support	as long as he as a major presidential candidate continues to suggest that we are going to turn over these islands	he is only encouraging the aggressors - the Chinese Communist and the Soviet aggressors - to press the United States
__label__Support	We haven't been doing enough of tha	part of the job of the next commander-in-chief, in keeping all of you safe, is making sure that we can see some of the 21st Century challenges and anticipate them before they happen
__label__Support	on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans	I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military
__label__noRel	he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress.	one Republican voted for it.
__label__noRel	Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country	there are 22000 miners out of work
__label__noRel	we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system	I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are
__label__noRel	Today of the millions of people who have now registered because of it	I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible
__label__noRel	You made the comment that the Gulf War coalition in '91 was far stronger than this	they haven't done it
__label__Support	Our tax rate for business in America is 35 percent	businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world
__label__noRel	this nation was embarrassed by this current administration's adoption of their policies	What happens in South Africa, where, for example, the Nobel Prize winner, 2 days ago, said this administration is seen as working with the oppressive government of South Africa
__label__noRel	African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated	I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate
__label__Support	the House did not pass it	It failed
__label__noRel	John Kerry and I believe we need to strengthen the sanctions on Iraq	We've made major progress in dealing here with a major issue with respect to nuclear proliferation
__label__Support	We should do whatever has to be done to train the Iraqis and to speed up that process	We have a plan for success
__label__noRel	We have less than half of the staff that we need there to complete that training	who've been negotiating with the Iranians
__label__noRel	We've got sanctions on Iran now	90 percent of the coalition casualties, Mr. Vice President, the coalition casualties, are American casualties
__label__noRel	These are people that I just happen to know and have a high regard for	They know what it's like not to have family leave or childcare
__label__Support	I'm going to wait until I see that that inflation rate is going down, before I even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that I've talked about	I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending
__label__noRel	And they don't want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens.	just as we have with the drug problem nationwide

__label__Support	we created an environment for the entrepreneurial spirit to be strong	Minority ownership of businesses are up

This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out
__label__Support	You told him you wanted to spread the wealth around	The whole premise behind Senator Obama's plans are class warfare, let's spread the wealth around
__label__Support	because of the new energy policy that we've put into effect	This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect

__label__noRel	there are things we can do	The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together
__label__noRel	I think that pattern is a dangerous thing to suggest would work for the Oval Office	I got a philosophical difference
__label__noRel	I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending	We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised

__label__noRel	first of all, referring to Secretary Dulles' press conference, I think if you read it all - and I know that you have - you will find that Secretary Dulles also indicated in that press conference that when the troops were withdrawn from Quemoy, that the implication was certainly of everything that he said, that Quemoy could better be defended	he is only encouraging the aggressors - the Chinese Communist and the Soviet aggressors - to press the United States
__label__noRel	let's help families right away by providing them a tax cut -- a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000	I am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that their first priority

__label__Support	We can't settle for anything but the best	I pointed out that it was my position that Americans must choose the best man that either party could produce
__label__noRel	If this report that we've read about today is true, and if Vice President Cheney ordered it and asked about this, do you think that, in the future, that your administration or the Bush administration would have sufficient and accurate enough intelligence to be able to make decisions about where to go next?	This vice president, when he was secretary of defense, cut over 80 weapons systems, including the very ones he's criticizing John Kerry for voting against
__label__noRel	We have got to have the courage to change	the changes are mind-boggling for world peace
__label__Support	which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense,	In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy,
__label__Support	I have no disagreement with the Vice President's position on that	gave some assurance that he really wanted to sit down and talk and to accomplish something and not just to make propaganda
__label__Support	just reject the allies going into lead- up to the war	They didn't
__label__Attack	I call that the "Ultimate Bridge to Nowhere	That's how he raises $3.6 trillion

__label__Support	This is a plan that is going to increase the bureaucracy by 20,000 people	he'll either have to raise your taxes by $900 billion or go into the Social Security surplus for $900 billion
__label__Support	The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation	I think this debate on Social Security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party
__label__noRel	we need a three-pronged attack	undermined the moral authority of our people and our country in the region
__label__noRel	I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done	I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up

__label__Support	We also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement	this is a very difficult situation
__label__Support	there's no substance to the charges	They know the charges are false
__label__noRel	And 95 percent of the people in the United States of America making less than $150,000 will get a tax break	No one making less than $250,000 under Barack Obama's plan will see one single penny of their tax raised whether it's their capital gains tax, their income tax, investment tax, any tax
__label__noRel	That's unacceptable from our standpoint	I think we have to make some planning assumption to proceed
__label__Support	We have got to do much more	I want new incentives for savings and investment for the young couples who are working hard so they can save and invest on their own on top of Social Security, not at the expense of Social Security, as the governor proposes
__label__noRel	you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes	And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committee's projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5%

__label__noRel	Let me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes	We need to cut the business tax rate in America
__label__noRel	if they aren't, my guess is then the board of governors will recommend sending the whole matter to the U.N. Security Council for the application of the international sanctions	it's a continuation of what he began his first answer with tonight
__label__Support	He is responsible for most of the major car bombings that have killed or maimed thousands of people	this is exactly the kind of track record we've seen over the years
__label__Support	what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn't yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now	that requires us to make some important choices
__label__noRel	What he's quoting is not the Senate Budget Commiitte	The difference is we've got a new policy
__label__Support	some people look up figures, and some people make up figures	John has just made up some very interesting figures
__label__noRel	On the question of the summit, I agree with the position of Mr. Nixon	under these circumstances, I, therefore, strongly urge and I will strongly hold
__label__noRel	The Social Security system was based on a false premise	the problem for the young people today is that they are paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out

__label__noRel	I prepared to be president	I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists
__label__noRel	I know there are things there in the Philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights, but what is the alternative	It'll draw an attack
__label__noRel	you were trying to—you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures	other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well

__label__noRel	You need more police	I'm satisfied with it
__label__noRel	it seems to me the record is clear	If it says tilt, you don't get any gun
__label__Support	Karl Marx said that the free enterprise system in a democracy can only continue to exist when they are at war or preparing far war	what Mr. Ford said about unemployment, that - insinuating that under Johnson and Kennedy that unemployment could only be held down when this country is at war.
__label__Support	We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens - leave them thinking that in some way, they're endangered and they would have no place to turn	to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on Social Security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check
__label__noRel	I think that really frustrates people is that so often political campaigns seem to be more about the politicians that are running than the people	I wonder if it's our fault, the candidates' fault
__label__noRel	We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures	His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information
__label__Support	These are dangerous times	I just care whether it works for America and whether it's going to make us stronger
__label__noRel	And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down	we need law and order
__label__noRel	stop-and-frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City	Unfortunately, race still determines too much

__label__Support	U.S. reliance on Arab oil as a percentage of total imports is much higher today than it was during the 1973 Arab oil embargo	the substantial loss of Arab oil could plunge the United States into depression
__label__noRel	a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past	so-called simple amendment would be used by mischievous men to destroy discriminations that properly belong, by law, to women respecting the physical differences between the two sexes, labor laws that protect them against things that would be physically harmful to them
__label__Support	We have to work with the police	So we have to do two things, as I said

__label__noRel	With John Kerry as president of the United States, we are committed to immediately implementing all of the reforms suggested by the 9/11 Commission	they haven't done it

__label__noRel	Quite often Congress has passed laws in the past designed to help people with uh - the ownership of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and education programs and so forth	the education cost has gone up uh - tremendously
__label__noRel	we certainly cannot have it in a presidential campaign	the best man that this nation can produce
__label__Support	what drives the cost of campaigns are the cost of advertising on television, radio, newspaper, mass mailing	if you want to cut the cost of campaigns, you have to open the airways
__label__Support	that means war	once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return

__label__noRel	The President answers that it didn't happen or, if it did, it was resolved later in a commission	I think this is something the American people see
__label__Support	I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan	I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending

__label__Support	They also rejected them in the effort to do the reconstruction in Iraq	just reject the allies going into lead- up to the war
__label__Support	I promise you the economy is going to get better	We're going into the next century a better America
__label__noRel	it's unfair to our children	John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government
__label__noRel	We're working with the Brits and the Germans and the French	then they came back and when the question was whether or not you provide them with the resources they needed -- body armor, spare parts, ammunition -- they voted against it
__label__noRel	We had 34 countries then; we've got 30 today	this is exactly the kind of track record we've seen over the years
__label__Support	that's where our society must head	there's a larger law
__label__noRel	there will be an international crisis	We need a president who has the experience
__label__noRel	The key is job training, education, investments in health care and education, environment, retirement security	It's their ingenuity

__label__noRel	that's part of America	This is a president who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country
__label__Support	we have to make some kind of forecast	I think we have to make some planning assumption to proceed

__label__noRel	You're 150 -- excuse me, I think it's a little more, about $100 million shy of what you ought to be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here	He said he voted for the $87 billion, and voted against it right before he voted for it
__label__noRel	That qualifies you for being president of the US.	the senator, whose boss is going to get it half way balanced in 4 years
__label__noRel	I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system	I just left Philadelphia
__label__Support	the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession.	I believe in the balanced budget.

__label__noRel	These are two individuals who have been for the war when the headlines were good and against it when their poll ratings were bad	if they couldn't stand up to the pressures that Howard Dean represented, how can we expect them to stand up to Al Qaida
__label__noRel	that's been part of my foreign policy	there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism, and so we have a distance to travel
__label__noRel	run our government	our opponents are stronger
__label__Support	which provides an incentive for industry to move into our major uh - metropolitan areas, into the inner cities	The Ford administration does have a very comprehensive program to help uh - our major metropolitan areas

__label__Support	we spend $73 billion to help 10 million low- and middle-income families better afford college	we ought to have an aggressive effort to make sure people are educated
__label__noRel	I want tax cuts for the middle-class families	having a $1.9 trillion tax cut, almost half of which goes to the wealthy, and a $1 trillion Social Security privatization proposal is the surest way to put our budget into deficit â€“ raise interest rates and put our prosperity at risk
__label__noRel	That is the true way I feel	Barack Obama is a man of great dignity
__label__noRel	We had 34 countries then; we've got 30 today	you demean the sacrifice of our allies when you say it's the wrong war, wrong place, wrong time, and oh, by the way, send troops

__label__noRel	We did all of those things knowing that that is how our economy would be heated up	what you had is you had overwhelming "deregulation

__label__noRel	with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase	I would like to make a change in the regulation that discriminates against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her father's or her husband's benefits, if he dies first, or what she has paid in; but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself, and she is entitled to more than she presently can get

__label__Attack	That is simply a lie.	Your party doesn’t say it
__label__Attack	we’ve never accomplished it	we’ve never walked away from it like he has done.

__label__noRel	We took away the individual mandate.	I beat Bernie Sanders.
__label__Support	I would be gathering up and making sure we had the comp–countries of the world coming up with 20 billion dollars	Instead of doing something about that

__label__noRel	He won’t ever look you in the eye and say that’s what he wants to do.	this is not a right wing problem this is a left-wing.
__label__noRel	Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws, and that’s what it is.	we’re going to put 500,000 charging stations and all of the highways that we’re going to be building in the future.
