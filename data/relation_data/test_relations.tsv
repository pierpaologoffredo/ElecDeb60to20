__label__Support	hold the lawyers responsible for that, certify that and hold the lawyer financially responsible if they don't do it; have a three-strikes-and-you're-out rule so that a lawyer who files three of these cases without meeting this requirement loses their right to file these cases	John Kerry and I have a plan to do something about it

__label__Support	That's just totally ridiculous	never have we ever, nor would we, support the idea of someone closing down a factory here and moving overseas

__label__Attack	Pretty much self-funding mine	Why isn’t she funding, not for $100 million, but why don’t you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?It’s $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public.
__label__noRel	We held to account a terrorist regime in Saddam Hussein	I'm talking about giving him four or five tools - not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision
__label__Support	That has the benefit of making sure our employers aren't breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs	so long as there's not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers' needs
__label__Attack	The haves are doing well	This economy is not growing fast enough

__label__noRel	Health care is priority number two	that is why we are maintaining a deterrent and trying to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage
__label__noRel	if we have allies	Here's the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you're getting from your employer
__label__Attack	we finally passed the Kassebaum bill	He wanted to give us this big system, that took over about one-seventh of the economy, that put on price controls, created all these state alliances, and would cost $1.5 trillion and force people into managed care, whether they wanted it or not
__label__noRel	I'm not some extremist out here	The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh - my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take 'em off on the corporations

__label__Support	This has been one of the highest level operations in the whole State Department right under the President himself	he simply doesn't know what he's talking about

__label__noRel	We can now impose a no-fly zone	we went in there alone
__label__Attack	it's okay for the wealthy to choose to send their kids to private schools	he said that he was not for choosing -- giving the parents the right to choose to send their children to public schools

__label__Support	They want to know that their president and their vice president will keep them safe	My first priority would be to keep this country safe
__label__noRel	I remember 1973 in the depth of the uh - energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to cut down on the waste of uh - gasoline, to cut down on the uh - speed of automobiles	I favor adoption

__label__noRel	Our relationship with the People's Republic of China is based upon the Shanghai Communique, of 1972	I think it would increase the influence of unelected staff members in the Congress who have too much influence already
__label__Support	I think it's clear that we're better off than we were four years ago	Now we need to focus on what do we need to do to be better off still
__label__noRel	Let's try to expand our markets abroad	It is a welfare system that is more like a third-world socialist country than what we would expect from the world's greatest democratic free-enterprise system

__label__Support	It's a great thing for companies to expand	I'm really calling for major jobs
__label__noRel	I'm not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut	The man loves his wife and I appreciate that a lot
__label__Support	I don't	the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program
__label__Support	When it comes to making college affordable, whether it's two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed	there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system
__label__noRel	I've gotten a lot of good experience in dealing with ordinary people over the last year and month	it's important for us to try
__label__noRel	I choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield	the right war was Osama bin Laden and Afghanistan

__label__Support	when you are reducing productivity at the same time that you are turning out printing-press money in excessive amounts, you're causing inflation	I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production

__label__noRel	for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong	The record does not show that
__label__noRel	we honor all the service that they've provided	this is a very important issue
__label__noRel	I hope people don't think that I'm questioning his patriotism when I say he used his words to describe his participation in that organization	We wanted to tie it to Social Security.
__label__Support	we need to do well for the rest of the world	Bob Dole, as I said earlier, is a man of courage, a man of principles, a man who crawled out of a fox hole on Riva Ridge in 1945 to save a wounded brethren
__label__Support	a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down	we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain
__label__Support	Wanda Blackmore I met here from Missouri, the first time she bought drugs with her drug discount card, she paid $1.14, I think it was, for about $10 worth of drugs	These cards make sense
__label__noRel	Wrong	In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy,
__label__noRel	the greenhouse effect is an important environmental issue	It requires taking as much as a trillion dollars out of the Social Security fund

__label__Support	I talk to the Republican leaders and they want it	I think I could go to Washington in a week and get everybody holding hands and get this bill signed
__label__noRel	Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system	The bills that I vetoed, the one for an additional $6 billion, was not a bill that would have solved our unemployment problems
__label__Support	we have to do something about that	there is other forms of racial profiling that goes on in America
__label__Support	John Kerry and I have consistently said that	It means that Saddam Hussein needed to be confronted
__label__Attack	Whether or not one makes decisions based on sound principles	whether or not you rely upon polls and focus groups on how to decide what the course of action is
__label__noRel	He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year	The terrorists have won each time

__label__noRel	I said we'd transition out of Afghanistan, and start making sure that Afghans are responsible for their own security	that is they want a stable world
__label__noRel	You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership	that means strong oversight, making sure that investors, taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors
__label__Support	as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released	it'll be released
__label__Support	A spirit of cooperation	It is going to require a new spirit
__label__noRel	I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the -- the policies and the laws to their advantage	That's the war against terror
__label__Support	When it comes to going after Osama bin Laden, you said, well, any president would make that call	the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran, you've been all over the map
__label__Support	In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country	I believe that since I've been in office, there have been six or eight areas of combat evolved in other parts of the world
__label__Support	some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations	stop sending $700 billion a year overseas
__label__noRel	That's not good for our country	it's bad, bad experience
__label__Support	I've served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service	I've just as high a devotion, just as high an opinion
__label__Support	I have brought into the top level, top levels of government, into the White House, into administrative offices of the Executive branch, into the judicial system, highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded	It's very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens

__label__Support	the chance to vote	I think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the opening up of opportunities - uh to black people
__label__Support	You've got to make the decision	you've got to make a decision
__label__noRel	No, of course not	I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country
__label__Support	if you really believe that the people of a state ought to make a decision on a matter of this kind	we ought to have a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the fifty states to make the choice
__label__noRel	that's a false choice	therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place.
__label__Support	I don't have a policy of stopping wind jobs in Iowa and that -- they're not phantom jobs	They're real jobs
__label__noRel	Until we got a Republican Congress, we finally got action	I believe we should

__label__Support	people who, for whatever reason, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns	I favor closing the gun show loophole
__label__Support	They're stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology	hacking into our computers
__label__noRel	That's basically unfair and not only is it unfair	because you had said that there isn't anything -- such a thing as clean coal
__label__Support	I don't see this, incidentally, as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea	I see an involvement by a thousand points of light
__label__noRel	We obviously have to stop this spending spree that's going on in Washington	it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy
__label__noRel	the way to defeat them long-term, by the way, is to spread freedom	They had a cease-fire three weeks ago
__label__Support	You cannot sit there in an international crisis and sit there and say, well, on the one hand, this is okay, and, on the other hand, this is okay	You can't have it both ways
__label__Support	But the notion that somehow, because I'm a man, I don't know what it's like to raise two kids alone, I don't know what it's like to have a child you're not sure is going to -- is going to make it -- I understand	I understand, as well as, with all due respect, the governor or anybody else, what it's like for those people sitting around that kitchen table
__label__noRel	it’s very intermittent	We believe people convicted of that crime deserve the death penalty, as does the legislation that's in the Congress that is supported by a bipartisan, including many Democrats of his party
__label__noRel	housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy	They're not going to follow an American president who says follow me into a mistake
__label__noRel	We're the best producers in the world	He’s done very little.
__label__noRel	I know again that you opposed the move that he made to try to cut off funding for the troops	If I say yes, then that means that we're reigniting the old Cold War

__label__Support	there may be hundreds of thousands of people who will starve or freeze to death in this winter	we do have interests there
__label__Support	so long as there's not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers' needs	I believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up
__label__Support	there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more	that's a problem
__label__Support	You know, no one had ever heard of Clarence Gideon, the man without a lawyer	he did it
__label__Attack	I think probably we're making a mistake night after night after night to cast the nation's future on a unit that small	I wish America had that kind of record

__label__noRel	I think we know well who's going to help clean up this environment	looking around here, at this group here, I suspect there are only three people here who are going to be affected: the president, me, and, Charlie, I'm sorry, you too

__label__noRel	I'm someone older than you	We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them

__label__noRel	I think he ought to be ashamed of mentioning that statement	I have had a couple of exceptions that I support - rape, incest and the life of the mother

__label__noRel	while Barack Obama was talking about reinstating those regulations, John on 20 different occasions in the previous year and a half called for more deregulation	a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past
