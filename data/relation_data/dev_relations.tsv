__label__noRel	I'm not even certain you were too excited about that	I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care
__label__Support	They don't even fight to reach those goals	They've tried to undo them
__label__Support	our values are violently contradicted by the kind of racial profiling that I know exists	the first Civil Rights Act legislation we would send to Congress would be a national ban on racial profiling

__label__Support	We're ahead of our six-year schedule	We've already got 20,000 out there

__label__noRel	I mean, there's a lot going on, a lotta opportunity	the government negotiating with the United States government for their release
__label__noRel	so they can take their child to a -- to a school that he's being more successful	you've been bombarded with advertisements suggesting that I've changed a position on this or that or the other
__label__noRel	if you don't think that this course that we've been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four	I shouldn't have a preference
__label__Support	leave this country in good shape	We've got to collect the taxes to do it

__label__noRel	Now, hundreds, thousands of good, decent people, whole cities up here in this state are adversely impacted because they would not move in a timely way	It's just not credible to say he's going to keep taxes down and balance budgets
__label__noRel	use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security	These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people
__label__noRel	I'm not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut	That's where the agreement ends
__label__noRel	I've laid out a plan by which I think we can be successful in Iraq	I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress.

__label__Attack	I think Mr. Kemp has unintentionally made a mistake in saying that President Clinton called for reduction of -- to 6 percent or whatever you said	The President himself suggested that the reduction in the growth of Medicare over the next five or six years ought to be held to 6 percent under the Republican plan, irrespective of the numbers, it will grow at 7 or even more percent
__label__Attack	"the lines of stem cells that he's made available, every scientist in the country will tell you, ""Not adequate,"" because they're contaminated by mouse cells, and because there aren't 60 or 70 -- they're are only about 11 to 20 now -- and there aren't enough to be able to do the research because they're contaminated"	I made the decision we wouldn't spend any more money beyond the 70 lines, 22 of which are now in action

__label__Support	we’re doing record numbers	We have to make our country totally successful

__label__Support	if you don't have health insurance, we're essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you're out there trying to get insurance on the individual market	we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold

__label__noRel	I think we ought to have incentives to do it	I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline

__label__noRel	It's a question of who they are	because of some of the mistakes that have been made
__label__Support	because of our leadership, because we didn't listen to the freeze -- the nuclear-freeze group, do you remember -- freeze it, back in the late 70s -- freeze, don't touch it; we're going to lock it in now or else we'll have war	I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home
__label__Support	we can take on this mission	All of these things we can do as Americans
__label__noRel	I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security,	to build a sense of community so we're all working together
__label__noRel	I think it's a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to.	Values begin at the top, in the White House
__label__Support	There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they then can use to make money	clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries

__label__noRel	he didn’t do it	we have a clear plan to improve our public schools that starts with getting our best teachers into the schools where we need them the most by creating incentives for them to go there
__label__noRel	they were defeated	I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important
__label__noRel	there isn't a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem	To extend it to all the world
__label__noRel	I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us	I think the matter is settled once and for all

__label__Support	now that the energy prices are high, I guess he's not advocating those big energy taxes right now	I'm not in favor of energy taxes

__label__Support	I made the recommendation to the president	The president made the decision
__label__noRel	I see what it does	he tried that in 1985
__label__noRel	We're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports	I voted against that
__label__Support	everybody knew that those of us who voted against the freezing of COLAs did so, we did so emphatically	That simply isn't true
__label__noRel	I did not say it is.	The president says I've changed my mind
__label__Support	my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities	I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives

__label__Support	You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators	You were wrong
__label__noRel	We're not making those choices	That makes a big difference
__label__noRel	there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind	the Arabs, the Japanese and folks in this country are going to start buying German treasuries
__label__noRel	I think it can only be that they're anticipating or hope	People aren't looking for more of the same
__label__Support	I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free	I support that
__label__Support	the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives	He still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq
__label__Support	Governor Clinton's philosophy is isolate them	I'm not going to do it
__label__noRel	I don't want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed	he was given a chance to vote, and he voted no
__label__noRel	They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other	please let's learn from history
__label__noRel	if we'd used smart diplomacy	It was a tribute after President Carter's election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99.5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools
__label__noRel	That's what got me into this race, so we could rebuild the American economy	I do not want any more trickle down government
__label__noRel	We have a divided nation	So four years ago I stood on a stage just like this one
__label__Support	They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance -- your insurance plan until you're 26 years old	if you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover

__label__Support	where we build the strongest alliances	I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did
__label__noRel	it worked	This is a family tax cut
__label__Support	we've had a chance to became now, contrary to our long-standing beliefs and principles, the arms merchant of the whole world	We've tried to buy success from our enemies

__label__Support	it never got passed	I never promoted Fannie Mae
__label__Support	what you have to do is make sure that CEOs don't benefit from this, because this could end up, in the long run, people making money off of this rescue plan	Barack Obama laid out four basic criteria for any kind of rescue plan here
__label__Support	That's budget neutral	That's a smart thing to do
__label__noRel	President Obama has not even put a credible plan on the table in any of his four years to deal with this debt crisis	We've been in very close touch with Mr. Mitterrand, Mr. Kohl, and others that have met with the leaders of the Soviet Union

__label__noRel	the right course for America's government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player	I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor's programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan

__label__noRel	"Our friends and allies have been saying, Gwen, ""Sit down. Talk. Talk. Talk."""	Suburbs are by and large integrated.
__label__Support	It had nothing to do with us	We were not involved
__label__noRel	what we're doing is saying that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities uh - where people with talent, black or any other minority, can fully qualify	that would make war imminent
__label__Attack	The theocracy controls the security apparatus	it surprises me that Senator McCain doesn't realize that Ahmadinejad does not control the security apparatus in Iran
__label__Support	he paid $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers	Concern about Iraq specifically focused on the fact that Saddam Hussein had been, for years, listed on the state sponsor of terror
__label__noRel	this enormous national debt, engineered by this administration, is harming these countries in fueling this immigration	The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts

__label__Support	This is serious business	that has very serious ramifications, as the intelligence community knows
__label__noRel	they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine	We hadn't done the work that ought to be done
__label__Support	Inflation is robbing us	I think he ought to be ashamed of mentioning that statement
__label__noRel	it's time we had that bresh of freth air (sic) -- breath of fresh air coming into our nation's capital and sweep out the old-boy network and the cronyism that's been so much a part of it that I've fought against for all these years	the money goes to them
__label__noRel	that plan includes speeding up the training of the military	I think it's time we get rid of PAC money
__label__Support	It's much more complex	We absolutely must
__label__Attack	it's bad	as though this was a humorous little incident
__label__Support	we don't administer it very well	the incentives that are in our current way of doing business, are what are killing us
__label__Support	none of that will happen anymore	over the next ten years you will see a big increase over the percentage of people that have pension plans, plus a secure Social Security system
__label__noRel	I think, joining with our allies and friends in a league of democracies, that we can effectively abridge their behavior	I understand your frustration and your cynicism
__label__noRel	We need somebody to simplify the code	it's your money
__label__noRel	When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it’s in business and trade, where we’re doing so badly	We are the sole remaining superpower
__label__noRel	stopped the Trident or delayed the Trident submarine	Fritz Mondale and I feel very strongly that if you educate your children that that's an effort and the way that you build up and make a stronger America.
__label__Support	It should be predicated upon the defense needs, the security needs, the strategic needs of the United States of America	that's how they'll be made under Bob Dole as president
__label__Support	More money is needed and I spend more money, but step one is to make sure we reform the system to have the system in place that leaves no child behind	one of the things that we have to be careful about in politics is throwing money at a system that has not yet been reformed
__label__Support	It's fair	They deserve the tax breaks, not the super wealthy who are doing pretty well
__label__Support	I think it's a disgrace that so far Mr. Ford's administration has blocked the passage of legislation that would've revealed by law every instance of the boycott	it would've prevented the boycott from continuing
__label__Support	it is high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism	I have no quarrel whatsoever with the things that have been done

__label__noRel	This is a body based in The Hague where unaccountable judges and prosecutors can pull our troops or diplomats up for trial	I propose a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all seniors
__label__Support	following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me	I think the matter is settled once and for all
__label__noRel	88 percent of the people -- the President claims 11 million are already covered	I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place
__label__noRel	we thought he had weapons of mass destruction	We're also going to have to work with the Karzai government
__label__Support	the cast as a result has gone up	I don't think the American people are getting their money's worth from the majority party that run this Congress
__label__noRel	What are we waiting for	Certainly we care about the people, we care about the children, we care about the tragedy
__label__Support	to do what is right for the American people	put government back on the side of the American people
__label__noRel	we invested in national security	That's just not right
__label__Support	the government bureaucracy is uh - just a horrible mess	This doesn't have to be
__label__Support	There are 200,000 people in California, for example, who have lost their defense related jobs	We can create millions of jobs in these new technologies

__label__noRel	I would like to point out that when we look at our programs in Latin America, we find that we have appropriated five times as much for Latin America as was appropriated by the previous Administration	I have
__label__noRel	that one doesn't sound good	With regard to the employer sanctions, we must have that

__label__Support	.So I believe that this election has become in part so—so conflict-oriented, so intense because there’s a lot at stake	It’s one of the most consequential elections that we’ve had.And that’s why I’ve tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president

Wade to issues relating to civil rights and civil liberties	that was one of the intellectual changes that took place in my career as I got a close look at it
__label__Support	it would also be very disturbing to our allies, all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty	If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition

__label__noRel	Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology	I don't believe, like the vice president does, in huge government

__label__noRel	We think that was important	The United States must be a nation strong
__label__noRel	That is not how we grow the economy	what is at stake here in this health care issue is the fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama
__label__Support	so many of them depend on it for their basic living, for their livelihood	It has created a floor under which seniors cannot fall
__label__noRel	I outlined a very specific program of increasing pay and allowances, reenlistment bonuses	But people that will respect the Constitution of the United State
__label__Support	to support the security of Israel	We have a very consistent policy in the Middle East
__label__noRel	That was said sarcastically, and you know that.	Not some of the military
__label__noRel	She’s a fighter	we're paying attention to it
__label__Support	I said we would change the way welfare works	even before the bill passed we'd moved nearly two million people from welfare to work, working with states and communities
__label__noRel	it seems to me that there should have - be an opportunity, uh - as long as it's voluntary, as long as there is no uh - compulsion whatsoever, that uh - an individual ought to have that right	We stopped that plan before
__label__Support	I noted that nobody was really benefitting except a very small group at the top	The average person wasn't benefitting
__label__Support	I have been willing to stand up to powerful interests like the big insurance companies, the drug companies, the HMOs, the oil companies	I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the -- the policies and the laws to their advantage
__label__noRel	We have people with no property	The problem with this version of Niagara Falls is that Senator Dole and Mr. Kemp would put the economy in a barrel and send it over the falls

__label__noRel	we held free elections	The administration was blocking us every step of the way

__label__Attack	It's time for a new administration to deal with the energy problem	The administration did not deal with it
__label__Support	We've got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college	Over the last eight years, we've seen that dream diminish
__label__Attack	I'm not going to make decisions that I think are wrong for America	My opponent is for joining the International Criminal Court
__label__noRel	You voted for the war	doesn't make sense
__label__noRel	I've argued that we should fully funded it	It is believed that probably 70% of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there
__label__Support	We want to balance this budget, get back to fiscal responsibility	We have a plan
__label__Support	my judgment is that they don't want to give their freedom up to become Communists	I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom
__label__Support	I've been fighting for proliferation the entire time -- anti-proliferation the entire time I've been in the Congress	we've watched this president actually turn away from some of the treaties that were on the table
__label__noRel	I think it–Kellyanne Conway.	No
__label__Support	I think what you can do is look at what they've done and recognize that they're not going to do very much in the future	an arms race doesn't lead to anything, it leads to another arms race and that's that

__label__Support	since the reserve was opened the price of oil on world markets has dropped $6 a barrel	Al Gore and I believed it was important in the short-term to reach into the strategic petroleum reserve
__label__noRel	just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldn't be, doesn't mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere	to produce the traditional kinds of American energy
__label__noRel	Now they have	Right now, I am the Democratic Party.
__label__noRel	we will do that	The bills that I vetoed, the one for an additional $6 billion, was not a bill that would have solved our unemployment problems
__label__Support	We've seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time	they're starting to finally make progress
__label__Support	You cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem	that's to make sure the education system works
__label__Support	We've done so in my own state	I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime
__label__noRel	It’s called prepaying your taxes.	It's much more complex
__label__Support	But it wasn't just that experience tapped into, it was my connection to the heartland of America	My experience as an executive will be put to good use as a mayor and business owner and oil and gas regulator and then as governor of a huge state
__label__Support	They're always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that	And of course Kuwait
__label__noRel	I'm thankful that the Constitution would allow a bit more authority given to the vice president also if that vice president so chose to exert it in working with the Senate and making sure that we are supportive of the president's policies and making sure too that our president understands what our strengths are	the grand parents are faced with
__label__Support	with safer mines, but also it's clean burning	We need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction
__label__noRel	The problem with this version of Niagara Falls is that Senator Dole and Mr. Kemp would put the economy in a barrel and send it over the falls	They delivered
__label__noRel	we created an OSHA - an Occupational Safety and Health Agency - for the protection of employees before the Federal Government had one in place	It's an election about the course of America
__label__noRel	Hundreds of people came up to me and said: God bless America	the fact of it is we're so far away from research that even comes close to that
__label__noRel	NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future	I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on earth
__label__Attack	if we continue to spend billions on them, will force us to cut Social Security, to cut Medicare, to cut these basic entitlements to people of very, very modest means	I'm not going to go to entitlements as a means for cutting that deficit when we're spending billions on something like Star Wars, when we're spending billions on other weapon systems which apparently the Vice President wants to keep in his back pocket or some place
__label__noRel	The person who wants to use a gun for an illegal purpose can get it whether it's registered or outlawed	part of the reason we have a difficult situation
__label__Support	put a unified court system in	While I was governor of Georgia, although I'm not a lawyer, we had complete reform of the Georgia court system
__label__Support	We need to get rid of that provision	It wasn't thought through properly
__label__noRel	They sent 40,000 American troops into Iraq without the body armor they needed	They passed the budget
__label__Support	we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features	it's just about finished already
__label__noRel	We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb	I believe in competition
__label__noRel	we need to reverse that.People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.	He really didn't have a new economic program until over 1300 days into his presidency
__label__Support	The president said he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through that full process. He didn't	I think he has not been candid with the American people
__label__Support	it wasn't a tactic	That's what's happening in Iraq
__label__Support	One of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure	it starts with making sure we have strong accountability
__label__Support	it's clear that the defense budget of this administration has taken defense as a percent of our national economy to a lower level than it was prior to Pearl Harbor	I don't think, Jim, that Bob Dole was suggesting that the defense of our country is a jobs or a socioeconomic program
__label__Support	we have a process in Washington where after you've served for a while you cash in, become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month, then take a leave, work on presidential campaigns, make sure you've got good contacts and then go back out	we have a strange situation
__label__noRel	stop the federal government's program that now gives low-interest loans and job training funds to companies that will actually shut down and move to other countries	I cannot let that stand
__label__noRel	Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries	this is a national security issue
__label__Support	We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them	the nature of our military's changed
__label__noRel	making sure that we're closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas	he wants to do away with the Midgetman and the MX, the modernization or our nuclear capability

__label__Support	They started from that little area, and now they’re in 32 different nations, Hillary	that’s why ISIS formed in the first place
__label__noRel	global warming needs to be taken very seriously	you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto
__label__Support	I think that was mean-spirited	I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training
__label__Support	Iran continued to sell oil to the United States	we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally - a strong ally of the United States
__label__Support	most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who aren't bigoted or aren't prejudiced	it's very important that we not overstep our bounds
__label__noRel	I think it's time we get rid of PAC money	But I don’t want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them.
__label__noRel	we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan	we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support
__label__Support	the decisions we make will have enormous practical consequences	Your responsibility is to show up on November the 5th
__label__Support	the focus should be where the problem is, which is the Congress of the United States, and particularly the majority in the Congress	The anti-Washington feeling, in my opinion, ought to be focused on the Congress of the United States
__label__noRel	That is absolutely proved over and over again	we've got to control our own energy
__label__Support	You've got to go to the people	I think that's the essence of leadership
__label__noRel	You work with Congress	He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for
__label__Support	we can enforce law	there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on -- not certainly only in this debate, but just in general on law
__label__Support	most of the new jobs will come from small business	That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business
__label__Support	we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is	it exists also among those who are inadequately trained; that is, those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education
__label__noRel	When you don't have any ideas, you don't have any agenda, and all you have is fear, that's all you can use	I would be firm
__label__noRel	They ceded responsibility to dealing with it to the Europeans	take it away from the special interests and have people go to Washington to serve
__label__Attack	I'm pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program	just a few years ago you said that's something you'd never do
__label__Support	we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent	they'll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions
__label__Support	We want a peaceful planet	We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they're going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war
__label__noRel	when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige	I think is very important for us to let them assume more and more of the burden and for us to bring that money back here and rebuild our infrastructure
__label__noRel	what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision	that is part of your plan
__label__Support	knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they're going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives	I think it's, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in
