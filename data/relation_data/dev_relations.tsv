__label__noRel	yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives	that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad
__label__Attack	on the big questions, about whether or not we should have gone into Afghanistan, the big question about whether we should have removed somebody in Iraq, I'll stand by those decisions	in a war, there's a lot of -- there's a lot of tactical decisions that historians will look back and say: He shouldn't have done that

__label__noRel	Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it	that means that the ordinary American out there who's collecting a paycheck every day

__label__noRel	Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country	We've got to start also holding people accountable
__label__noRel	That's not true	we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression
__label__noRel	They're moving faster toward a nuclear weapon	This is the world's largest sponsor of -- of terrorism
__label__noRel	how is it that we shredded so many regulations	The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends
__label__noRel	We all assume that the tax cuts will be permanent	Part of my tax package which is paid for in my balanced budget plan would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains from people when they sell their homes

__label__Support	t can never be because we make concessions	Yes, we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home
__label__noRel	What I cared about is could we work together	There is a man here in this audience named Hugo Berlanga
__label__noRel	the president of the United States has -- has led with a steady hand and clear vision	it undermines our credibility by backing up the point when we make it that all options are on the table
__label__noRel	I've been with him every step of the way	It's not only the old industries that are failing, it's also the new ones

__label__noRel	you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now	the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this
__label__noRel	Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah - cha- in - in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work	we might channel specific uh targeted job - job - uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people - uh and also sharing with uh - local governments the uh - payment of salaries which would uh - let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level
__label__Support	make sure that we're investing in the American people	I think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go
__label__Support	that can work with the Congress	I'm prepared to do so
__label__noRel	I would cite that as a major accomplishment	we're investing a much smaller percentage of our income in the things you just asked about than all of our major competitors
__label__noRel	He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he's been in the United States Senate	this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy
__label__noRel	we show the world that we have a supply of our own	we only have three to four percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil
__label__noRel	Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States	the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we're going to get the middle class back on track
__label__noRel	You have to be a CPA to understand what he just said	actually the number I have received 72 cents for every $1 a man receives in a comparable job

__label__noRel	I think you put your finger on a major problem	it was not tough enough on the criminal
__label__noRel	also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more	we've got to champion small business
__label__Support	And our eighth graders number one in English and also in math	First time one state had been number one in all four measures
__label__noRel	that, too, will require some choices	I think that we're on the right track
__label__Support	the only place he can go to balance that budget is to raid the Social Security Trust Fund	how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do.
__label__noRel	we're investing a much smaller percentage of our income in the things you just asked about than all of our major competitors	We have to both bring down the deficit and get our economy going through these kinds of investments in order to get the kind of wealth and jobs and incomes we need in America
__label__noRel	I'm prepared to do so	Housing is up
__label__noRel	transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption	on the key issues that are of importance to American families, Joe Biden's always been on the right side
__label__noRel	I believe we have to have some way of checking hand guns before they're sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them	we're making progress
__label__noRel	we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain	a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down
__label__Support	we've got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there	who's a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts
__label__Support	so was the banking industry	so were housing advocates

__label__Support	This is the world's largest sponsor of -- of terrorism	I'll tell you what's worse A nuclear-armed Iran which triggers a nuclear arms race in the Middle East
__label__noRel	to those who are poor, who don't have adequate health care, who have been cheated too long with our tax programs, who've been out of jobs, whose families have been torn apart	It calls for more of the same
__label__Support	That's the best way to get people back in the system	That's what Washington, D.C. needs
__label__Support	which, to me, shows a very great insensitivity to giving deprived families a better chance in life	This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election
__label__noRel	There are some programs that are very important that are under funded	John, it's been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending
__label__noRel	The secretary of defense has made it absolutely clear, we didn't walk anything back	There is no difference between our view and theirs
__label__noRel	You said that there was no history of violence between Shia and Sunni	Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what
__label__noRel	on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush	Senator McCain talks a lot about earmarks
__label__noRel	I believe in it	I think that something can be done from there
__label__Support	they're the ones that, with the encouragement of Senator Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington	one of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
__label__noRel	have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis	we've got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less
__label__noRel	we need to have fixed-cost contracts	the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody
__label__noRel	we have to move swiftly	If we're lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen
__label__noRel	Senator McCain's campaign chairman's firm was a lobbyist on behalf of Fannie Mae, not me	I believe that it's rescue
__label__Support	I'm absolutely delighted that the League is sponsoring these debates and that we are	we are able to now speak to the American public and address the issues in a way such as this
__label__Support	we've got to strengthen our military long-term	that means a strong military
__label__Support	as a chief executive that's balanced ten budgets in a row	let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down

__label__Support	The government has a role	It is to fully fund the McKinney Act

__label__Support	we continue to grow	I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze
__label__Support	he's been president of the United States	I really don't think there's anything that I could say to President Truman that's going to cause him, at the age of seventy-six, to change his particular speaking manner
__label__Support	We have made progress in recent years	fortunately, great advances have been made by women achieving the kind of equality that they were too long denied
__label__Support	The president got it done	the story, I think, is a good one
__label__Support	I fight for equality and justice	All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith
__label__Support	we did it in a way that we got the private sector to involve itself with the public sector on private industry councils throughout America that serve over the service delivery areas	one of the accomplishments I'm proudest of is the authorship of the Job Training Partnership Act that has trained and educated and employed over three million young people and adults that are economically disadvantaged
__label__noRel	He is right	It's in spite of their opposition
__label__noRel	I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America	That's not true
__label__noRel	We can't expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to take their life savings or their company's money and invest in America if they think we're headed to the road to Greece	then you cut education spending when you came into office
__label__noRel	make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence	Free trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement

__label__Support	Our nation needs to be credible and strong	it requires a clear vision, a willingness to stand by our friends, and the credibility for people both friend and foe to understand when America says something
__label__noRel	the number of 50 million Americans not benefitting from our tax cut program is absolutely wrong	a very exciting tax credit program that I hope I'll have a chance to talk about later, Bernie, that encourages savings by people early in life and any time in life by having the federal government match savings for the 75 million Americans who make $100,000 or less up to $2,000 a year
__label__Support	we've been unable to persuade him to withdraw	we are in a very difficult position
__label__noRel	we were lectured to all the time	We're a freedom-loving nation
__label__noRel	in the inner city areas, that in cooperation with the local government and the national Government, and using tax incentives and with cooperating with the private sector, that we have development zones	They were public employment that these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there are jobs with a future
__label__Support	three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration	he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen
__label__Support	I've listened to both sides, and if they would talk to one another instead of throwing rocks	I think we could get a lot done
__label__Support	to do this peacefully	you've got to get them to change their minds
__label__noRel	We have serious differences with the Soviet Union	go forward as fast as we can
__label__noRel	if it gets overturned, then we'll end up with marriage being defined by courts	they're proving today, every state, that they can manage them adequately
__label__noRel	I was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out	the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we're going to get the middle class back on track
__label__Support	We ought to say this is good	the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same path
__label__Support	everyone of them -- the boys' club leaders, the ministers -- all of them were saying pass enterprise zones	I need the help of everybody across this country to get it passed in a substantial way by the Congress
__label__Support	During the time that the vice president and the president have been in office, 4 million more Americans have fallen into poverty	We have to do better
__label__Support	we've made great progress from the days when I was young and when this country didn't even know it had a racial problem	I believe in it
__label__Support	I promise you that that will happen	As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration
__label__noRel	Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused	Senator Obama didn't mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs
__label__Support	we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland	It's going to be one of my highest priorities
__label__noRel	I pay for every dime of it	I've done there along with Senator Clinton
__label__noRel	that's been his philosophy as a presidential candidate	if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent
__label__noRel	if we ever have to take action, unlike when we took office, we will have the world behind us	We lost three other brave Americans
__label__noRel	if there's anybody here who thinks there aren't agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington	you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now
__label__noRel	we've got to make sure that we've got oversight over this whole process	There is no doubt about it

__label__noRel	what happens to our country as we stand on the brink of a new century, a time of extraordinary possibility	in any event, I understand the problems
__label__noRel	I think they ought to look at us as a country that understands freedom where it doesn't matter who you are or how you're raised or where you're from, that you can succeed	in the last, or two decades ago, it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because it's causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world

__label__Support	The president rushed our nation to war without a plan to win the peace	I believe the president made a huge mistake, a catastrophic mistake, not to live up to his own standard, which was: build a true global coalition, give the inspectors time to finish their job and go through the U.N. process to its end and go to war as a last resort

__label__noRel	Senator Obama wants government to do the job	it's time we had that bresh of freth air (sic) -- breath of fresh air coming into our nation's capital and sweep out the old-boy network and the cronyism that's been so much a part of it that I've fought against for all these years

__label__Attack	that's an excuse	you can't say, because Saddam might have done it 10 years from now, that's a reason
__label__noRel	You and others in this great country have worked hard and done a great deal to give your children and your grandchildren the blessings of a better America	A president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that he's promised
__label__noRel	That's been his philosophy in the private sector	what's happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for America's young people

__label__Support	I see a situation where the Senator from Indiana has now jumped off the reservation	I think that's a mistake

__label__noRel	what we've seen over the last four years is something I don't want to see over the next four years	I absolutely believe that America has a -- a responsibility, and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that -- that make the world more peaceful
__label__noRel	as we've done with the auto industry	when we don't ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education
__label__noRel	we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented	she's a role model to women and other -- and reformers all over America
__label__Support	I've done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans	To involve them in the administration of government and the feeling that they belong to the societal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and in the executive branch is a very important commitment which I am trying to realize and will continue to do so in the future
__label__noRel	Spending was only up something like 4 percent	the formula I've given you works
__label__noRel	We can't tolerate it anymore	I think in terms of equality of opportunity, that we judge people as individuals

__label__noRel	large businesses that can afford it, we've got a choice	I think that in ten years, we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer have to import oil from the Middle East or Venezuela

__label__Support	Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it	The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place
__label__noRel	Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh - debates	a very small investment of taxpayer's money - in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh - putting forward of uh - two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the - in the construction industry
__label__Support	There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it's rough	I think that we're on the right track
__label__noRel	this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk	I've done there along with Senator Clinton
__label__Support	we didn't sit around	We went out and built housing

__label__Attack	I hope we get a chance to talk about education, but that's what the vice president talked about	I think the most important thing we can do is have a first-class public school system
__label__noRel	we have to go on and balance this budget while we protect Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment	If we do those things, we can build that bridge to the 21st century
__label__noRel	I think that is a continuation of the last eight years	I think, that we've got to ask ourselves is, yes, we've got to solve this problem short term
__label__Support	You just give me a job	Put those jobs in the inner cities instead of doing diplomatic deals and shipping them to China where prison labor does the work
__label__noRel	we can't afford these escalating costs	the country that just freed three Americans
__label__Attack	the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system.	Senator McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator
__label__noRel	We ought to help move a million people from welfare to work	We should give a tax cut, targeted to child rearing and education, to buying a first home and paying for health care
__label__noRel	If we invest in a serious energy policy	Sure I do
__label__noRel	save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare	we've put it through a good economic model
__label__noRel	this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy	I'm going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk
__label__noRel	I have fought to cut spending	It has to have accountability and oversight
__label__noRel	in terms of the cutting of the Coast Guard, the Democratic controlled Congress, so please help us with that, who cut $70 million from the Coast Guard out of the interdiction effort on narcotics.	You have to make choices
__label__Support	I feel strongly that marriage should be between a man and a woman	I think marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman
__label__Support	I think the American people understand it hasn't worked	it hasn't worked

__label__Support	that's the economic package again	the first thing we have to do is get you a job
__label__Attack	We have to obviously cut spending	Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs
__label__noRel	It doubles about every -- every five or so years	I want to bring it back and get back good jobs and rising take-home pay
__label__Support	The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel	doesn't make sense
__label__Support	we can have a tax cut	my priority would be to help the families who need it with child rearing and education and buying a first-time home and helping for health care costs
__label__Support	I believe that I can't legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith	I disagree with them, as do many
__label__Support	her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes	Her tax plan is a disaster
__label__noRel	have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis	We've got to invest in science and technology
__label__noRel	We exempt small businesses	the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on
__label__noRel	it's a gateway	over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow
__label__Support	because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time	The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place
__label__Support	have the smartest people in America come together, come up with recommendations	what we have to do with Medicare is have a commission
__label__Support	I can walk into that Oval Office anytime and give him my judgment and he might agree or he might not	we're not far apart on anything
__label__Support	He said, "I wouldn't move heaven and earth to get bin Laden."	Prior to the election, prior to the -- him being sworn in, Governor Romney was asked the question about how he would proceed

__label__Support	That was the assessment	we said exactly what the intelligence community told us that they knew
__label__noRel	we can create 700,000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030	if there's anybody here who thinks there aren't agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington

__label__noRel	I have kept the faith with our country	we need campaign finance reform
__label__Support	He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense	It's very simple for him to clear it up

__label__noRel	except for those people who have the gold-plated Cadillac insurance policies that have to do with cosmetic surgery and transplants and all of those kinds of things	if we're going to get serious in terms of research
__label__Support	we need campaign finance reform	I believe that a lot of people are skeptical about people in politics today
__label__Support	they no longer have to pay any federal income tax at all	We also dropped 5 million people totally off the federal income tax rolls

__label__Attack	Not necessarily be in power, but here's what I'll say about the $87 billion	I made a mistake in the way I talk about it
__label__noRel	we've got a lot of work to do	I promise you that that will happen

__label__Support	Secondly, we're going to do everything we can using governmental support of business agencies such as the Small Business Administration to help women business owners have an opportunity to invest and begin businesses and make larger incomes themselves	one of those goals is to eliminate the pay gap between men and women
__label__noRel	that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that they're not drilling, use them or lose them	Did you get that? Look at
__label__noRel	we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper	they will be a market for our goods and products without having to pay -- without us having to pay the billions of dollars -- the billion dollars and more that we've already paid

__label__noRel	The last thing we need now is another war	That's why there's also an investigation headed by Tom Pickering, a leading diplomat from the Reagan years, who is doing an investigation as to whether or not there are any lapses, what the lapses were, so that they will never happen again
__label__Support	through this economic crisis, most of the people that I know have had a difficult time	through this bailout package, I was wondering what it is that's going to actually help those people out

__label__Support	Our initial military success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated	then the war was very badly mishandled

__label__noRel	He went to the U.N. and in his speech at the U.N. he said six times -- he talked about the YouTube video	the loss of these four Americans who were murdered

__label__noRel	that's been his philosophy as a presidential candidate	We have fewer people working today than we had when the president took office
__label__Support	I'll make sausage	Put those jobs in the inner cities instead of doing diplomatic deals and shipping them to China where prison labor does the work
__label__noRel	The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel	We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control
__label__noRel	yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives	I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake
__label__noRel	They can do better	you could do what the people want, and that's create enterprise zones
__label__Attack	The secretary of defense has made it absolutely clear, we didn't walk anything back	They see, when we say that these options are on the table, the secretary of defense walked them back

__label__Support	These have been priorities of mine since I got to the Senate	I've focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal
__label__Attack	The Vice President ignored them	A report on international terrorism chaired by the Vice President was released and made some very specific recommendations about how to deal with terrorism
__label__noRel	I've done there along with Senator Clinton	we've got to make sure that we're competing in education
__label__Support	In all those elements, Governor Reagan has repeatedly spoken out against them	which, to me, shows a very great insensitivity to giving deprived families a better chance in life
__label__noRel	We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system	we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country
__label__noRel	I think you're going to see a change in those polls	I have too much friendship for him
__label__Support	It will require some funds	we ought to be prepared to provide those funds
__label__noRel	Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs	we need earmark reform

__label__noRel	as he said, his object is a single payer system	She understands reform
__label__Support	I think they're right	on the big questions, about whether or not we should have gone into Afghanistan, the big question about whether we should have removed somebody in Iraq, I'll stand by those decisions
__label__noRel	Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there	There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there
__label__noRel	my priority would be to help the families who need it with child rearing and education and buying a first-time home and helping for health care costs	these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system
__label__Attack	it doesn't work	Senator McCain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut
__label__Attack	Governor Carter again is talking in broad generalities	that's one of the major issues in this uh - campaign of 1976
__label__Support	he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break	how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do.
__label__Support	It's not just about the differential with respect to women	I think we have a ways to go

__label__noRel	We can help people to live better lives	Capital gains, one more point on that
__label__noRel	This isn't a question of a little charity for the homeless	A lot of them are mentally sick
__label__noRel	it's simply inaccurate	As they learned more facts about exactly what happened, they changed their assessment
__label__noRel	he suggests that we have 27 years' supply of natural gas, 47 years' supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really. all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and that's going to be enough	that prices may go up
__label__noRel	She's cut the size of government	I make no apology for that
__label__Support	I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy	the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there
__label__Support	this is a president who's gone out and done everything he has said he was going to do	this talk about this -- this weakness. I -- I don't understand what my friend's talking about here
__label__Support	we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded	we will come home with victory and with honor
__label__Support	They're not all Republicans	I might just say I'm from a large family
__label__Support	I believe we have to have some way of checking hand guns before they're sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them	I support the Brady bill which would impose a national waiting period unless and until a state did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records
__label__noRel	I agree with that	when Senator Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, "Yes, and we'll sell our oil to China."
__label__Support	I'll get us on track to a balanced budget	we're going to have to get to a balanced budget
__label__noRel	I think I did a much better job	Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years
__label__noRel	we've got to cut spending	we call a Google for government saying we'll list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who
__label__Support	for example, if we're convinced that a Third World country that's got a lot of debt would reform itself	I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions
__label__noRel	we've got a lot of work to do	to stand here and after eight years and say that you're going to lead on controlling spending
__label__Support	You judge on the record.	You're judged by the entire record.
__label__Attack	Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit	how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do.
__label__noRel	Ireland pays 11 percent	Do you know that it's gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people
__label__Support	right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP	We are going to start the engine rolling again
__label__Support	we need to do is to go back to the very same policies that got us there	we have fought back for four years to get out of that mess
__label__noRel	We're a freedom-loving nation	I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans
__label__Support	we can have more exchange with Poland or with any other of the Iron Curtain countries which show some desire to take a different path than the path that has been taken by the ones that are complete satellites of the Soviet Union	it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them
__label__Attack	All of these things can be done	I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis
__label__Support	I try hard to put myself in that position and imagine what it would be like, but I've always been part of the majority, never part of a minority group	I don't think I can understand fully what it would be like
__label__noRel	I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut	I was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out
__label__noRel	we'll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome	we didn't sit around
__label__noRel	taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the 21st century	as we've done with the auto industry
__label__Support	we change our tax code so we're giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here	we're going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it's come surging back
__label__noRel	we've got to fix the system	the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug
__label__noRel	I want to have the military keeping the peace	I volunteered for the Army
__label__noRel	if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close	John, it's been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending
__label__noRel	what we are looking at today is trying to judge once again the breadth of experience and the maturity of someone taking on this kind of a task	a George Bush administration will pursue that policy
__label__noRel	In Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries	the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on
__label__noRel	We have got to become more concerned about people who play by the rules and get the balance we require	the kind of thing you're doing here tonight, build a consensus and then do it and then go on to the next one
__label__Support	we are sending $700 billion a year overseas to countries that don't like us very much	Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations
__label__Support	in industry today, we're producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973	As for saving energy and conserving, the American people haven't been doing badly at that
__label__noRel	They delivered what they called malaise.	the president has failed to put forth a plan to deal with those deficits and if everything believes that everything is corning up roses, perhaps the vice-president should join me as I travel around the country and speak to people.
__label__noRel	nothing has been done	I've done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans
__label__noRel	When this administration says that all options are on the table, they send out senior administration officials that send all these mixed signals	when they see us putting daylight between ourselves and our allies in Israel, that gives them encouragement
__label__Support	It's the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list beginning in January of 1989	We need a president who will lead on this issue
__label__noRel	I've thought about an administration of people who represent all America, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy	that the money wouldn't go into the hands of a few but would go to help people
__label__noRel	Let's have a status of forces agreement to make sure that we secure our gains	They're four years closer toward a nuclear weapon
__label__noRel	we need to do is to go back to the very same policies that got us there	not just in Detroit
__label__noRel	We haven't been paying attention to them	You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes
__label__noRel	The mayor of New York, Mayor Bloomberg, just imposed an across- the-board spending freeze on New York City	If we make investments now so that people have coverage
__label__noRel	that will help us create jobs in America	Maybe that's why he's asked for 860 -- sought and proposed $860 billion worth of new spending
__label__noRel	we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat	They inform on the bad guys
__label__noRel	I'm going to give them $5,000 to take with them wherever they want to go	We invented the auto industry
__label__noRel	we fixed it	John, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound
__label__Support	we've excluded from the process the normal friendship of our allies	We have not known what we've wanted and we've been out-traded in almost every instance
__label__noRel	when they see us putting daylight between ourselves and our allies in Israel, that gives them encouragement	The vice president was put in charge of those negotiations by President Obama and they failed to get the agreement
__label__Support	They look at Washington and see people pointing fingers and casting blame and saying one thing and doing another	they don't want any part of politics
__label__noRel	I am a Catholic	It basically protected states from the action of one state to another
__label__noRel	We've got to invest in science and technology	The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place
__label__Support	I'm very pleased that the Fraternal Order of Police in Little Rock, Arkansas endorsed me	I think they see I'm trying to strengthen the anti-crime legislation
__label__Support	I've put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort	we have to move swiftly
__label__noRel	When they see Russia watering down any further sanctions, the only reason we got a U.N. sanction is because Russia watered it down and prevented these central bank sanctions in the first place	we have them in place because of Congress

__label__noRel	Both at home and abroad, he has proposed wrong and reckless policies	He's praised George Bush as a good economic steward and Dick Cheney as somebody who's -- who shows great wisdom and judgment
__label__noRel	I have a long record	we've got to make sure that we've got oversight over this whole process
__label__Support	He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs	how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do.

__label__Support	He repeated it again in a television debate that we had	Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here
__label__Support	When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question	I have, I have
__label__Support	Who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control	I've fought to simplify it
__label__noRel	that means that the ordinary American out there who's collecting a paycheck every day	doesn't make sense
__label__noRel	we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain	stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we're giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States

__label__noRel	I've been involved these issues for many, many years	lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works
__label__Attack	I couldn't do that to Ronald Reagan, now, next year or any other time.	I'm not sure, because of my concept of the vice presidency, that if I didn't, I'd go doing what Mr. Mondale has done with Jimmy Carter; jump away from him
__label__Support	Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what	We've been successful in Afghanistan

__label__Support	It was a glorious day	It was a superb occasion
__label__Support	if we do it's an open invitation to others to do the same	there can be no concessions under any circumstances

__label__noRel	$18 billion is important	we also have to have nuclear power
__label__Support	I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help	I believe that that would help in terms of shelter
__label__noRel	They say the military option's on the table, but it's not being viewed as credible	That's why there's also an investigation headed by Tom Pickering, a leading diplomat from the Reagan years, who is doing an investigation as to whether or not there are any lapses, what the lapses were, so that they will never happen again

__label__Support	It is just wrong	the first Civil Rights Act legislation we would send to Congress would be a national ban on racial profiling

__label__noRel	She'll be my partner	with the Democrats in charge of Congress, things have gotten worse
__label__Attack	That is not good for America's position in the world, and the world notices	that's undermining our long-term competitiveness
