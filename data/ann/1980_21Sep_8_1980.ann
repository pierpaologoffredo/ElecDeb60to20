T111	Premise 19395 19544	in most cases, that failure to meet the test was because of a lack of manning requirements, an inability to fill many of the slots in those divisions
T112	Premise 19551 19714	I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980 - this very month - that there is a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9

T124	Claim 23084 23175	That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up

T184	Premise 29791 29961	I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America - the large cities of this country - are in worse shape today than they were in 1960
T185	Claim 29963 30166	It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America
T186	Premise 30182 30497	just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits
T187	Claim 33002 33051	in my view, this is not the answer to the problem
T188	Claim 32342 32385	It will come from the pockets of the people
T189	Premise 32274 32340	John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from
T190	Claim 32387 32465	It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas
T191	Premise 32471 32643	the problem is, with Governments - Federal, State and Local - taking $.44 out of every dollar earned, that the Federal Government has pre-empted too many of the tax sources
T192	Claim 32669 32734	Pittsburgh does not have the money to fix the leaking water mains
T193	Premise 32749 32786	the Federal Government has pre-empted
T194	Premise 32793 32916	the Federal Government is going to turn around and say, well you have this problem; we will now hand you the money to do it
T195	Claim 32922 32963	the Federal Government doesn't make money
T196	Premise 32965 32996	It just takes - from the people
T197	Premise 33053 33263	Stand in the South Bronx as I did, in the spot where Jimmy Carter made his promise that he was going to, with multi-billion dollar programs, refurbish that area that looks like bombed-out London in World War II
T198	Premise 33265 33300	I stood there, and I met the people
T199	Premise 33306 33367	I heard them ask just for something that would give them hope
T200	Claim 33373 33463	I believe that, while all of the promises have been broken, they've never been carried out
T201	Claim 33469 33527	I believe that my plan might offer an opportunity for that
T202	Premise 33529 33677	if we would move into those areas and let, encourage - with the tax incentive - the private sector, to develop and to create the jobs for the people
T203	Claim 33840 34123	It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country
T204	Claim 34164 34248	in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth
T205	Claim 34267 34309	It's because they have lost their industry
T206	Premise 34363 34493	they no longer present the kind of viable economic climate that makes it possible for industry to remain there, or to locate there
T207	Claim 34495 34577	I think Government has a responsibility to find jobs for the youth of this country
T208	Claim 34588 34686	the place to start is to assist in the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild
T209	Claim 35684 35830	I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it's going to cost
T210	Premise 35855 35965	all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver
T211	Premise 35967 36226	When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver
T212	Premise 36234 36262	we've seen what has happened
T213	Claim 36264 36335	We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised
T214	Premise 36337 36438	we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term
T215	Premise 36440 36533	Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%
T216	Claim 36698 36773	I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan
T217	Premise 36539 36679	nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - that's about 18% on an annualized basis - what it's going to be
T218	Premise 36775 37020	His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information
T219	Premise 37022 37070	He went so far as to call it "brutal economics."
T220	Claim 37790 37936	I'm going to wait until I see that that inflation rate is going down, before I even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that I've talked about
T221	Claim 37942 38088	I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending
T222	Premise 37207 37304	I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done
T223	Premise 37321 37360	it's gotten to be about $122 difference
T224	Premise 37362 37384	Somebody worked it out
T225	Premise 37390 37571	they figured out that between the tax cut that Governor Reagan is promising the American people, and the tax cut that Jimmy Carter is promising in 198I, his is worth about $122 more
T226	Premise 37687 37788	one is going to give you $122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a $20,000-a-year income
T227	Premise 37576 37681	you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes
T228	Claim 38476 38491	I don't have to
T229	Premise 38493 38505	I've done it
T230	Premise 38507 38619	We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures
T231	Premise 38621 38760	And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committee's projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5%
T232	Claim 38763 38817	which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated
T233	Premise 38823 38968	eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how. how well it could be done
T234	Claim 39584 39624	I speak with some confidence of our plan
T235	Premise 39634 39799	I took over a state - California - 10% of the population of this nation - a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world
T236	Premise 39805 39838	that state we controlled spending
T237	Premise 39840 39887	We cut the rate of increase in spending in half
T238	Premise 39893 40006	at the same time, we gave back to the people of California - in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts - $5.7 billion
T239	Claim 40484 40536	I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983
T240	Premise 40542 40688	it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that's what he's counting on for his plan
T241	Premise 40694 40868	he's going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget
T242	Claim 40870 40959	We believe that that's too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people
T243	Premise 40008 40062	I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned
T244	Premise 40068 40132	among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending
T245	Premise 40138 40356	the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment
T246	Claim 40358 40401	We have considered inflation in our figures
T247	Premise 40403 40482	We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative
T248	Claim 41282 41406	Spending, in other words. more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government
T249	Premise 41115 41280	despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office
T250	Claim 41992 42117	I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military
T251	Claim 42123 42193	I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up
T252	Premise 41412 41670	on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans
T253	Premise 42263 42323	some people look up figures, and some people make up figures
T254	Claim 42329 42380	John has just made up some very interesting figures
T255	Premise 42382 42418	We took the Senate report, of course
T256	Claim 42424 42581	we did factor in our own ideas with regard to increases in the projected military spending that we believe would, over a period of time, do what is necessary
T257	Claim 42806 42949	I think being Governor of California is probably the closest thing to the Presidency, if that's possible, of any executive job in America today
T258	Premise 42960 42989	it is the most populous state
T259	Claim 42666 42709	we did cut the increase in spending in half
T260	Premise 42721 42800	John doesn't quite realize - he's never held an executive position of that kind
T261	Claim 43020 43121	we reduced, in proportion of other states, the per capita spending, the per capita size of Government
T262	Premise 43124 43227	we only increased the size of Government one-twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years
T263	Premise 43233 43418	one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt
T264	Claim 44722 44797	I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival
T265	Claim 45628 45775	I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader
T266	Premise 45777 45812	That's what elections are all about
T267	Claim 44799 44850	For a belief that law must be based on a higher law
T268	Claim 44852 44906	For a return to traditions and values that we once had
T269	Premise 44908 45058	Our Government, in its most sacred documents - the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and all - speak of man being created, of a Creator
T270	Premise 45060 45089	That we're a nation under God
T271	Premise 45096 45247	I have thought for a long time that too many of our churches have been too reluctant to speak up in behalf of what they believe is proper in Government
T272	Premise 45253 45401	they have been too too lax in interfering, in recent years, with Government's invasion of the family itself, putting itself between parent and child
T273	Premise 45403 45475	I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California
T274	Claim 46283 46467	to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state
T275	Premise 46134 46203	certainly the church has the right to take a position on moral issues
T276	Claim 46575 46673	I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual
T277	Premise 46474 46573	Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion
T278	Premise 46679 46920	for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of
T279	Claim 47217 47247	I believe in freedom of choice
T280	Claim 47249 47324	I don't believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that
T281	Claim 47326 47417	I don't believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary
T282	Premise 46926 47211	he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges - that only judges that hold a certain, quote, "view," on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government
T283	Claim 47743 47881	for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong
T284	Premise 47419 47483	On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago
T285	Premise 47489 47737	I have said freely, all over this country, that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, important as it is, and important as my religious faith is to me - it's a very deeply personal matter
T286	Premise 47891 48066	not once, but twice - in 1971 - I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools
T287	Premise 48068 48254	I think mother ought to whisper to Johnny and to Susie, as they button their coats in the morning and leave for the classroom, "Be sure to say a prayer before you start your day's work."
T288	Claim 48259 48411	I don't think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite
T289	Claim 48596 48627	I don't think that's a bad idea
T290	Claim 48629 48686	I think all of us should have a respect for innocent life
T291	Premise 48443 48589	The litmus test that John says is in the Republican platform, says no more than the judges to be appointed should have a respect for innocent life
T292	Claim 49229 49254	I happen to believe it is
T293	Claim 49080 49153	I do believe that maybe we could find the answer through medical evidence
T294	Premise 49155 49228	if we would determine once and for all, is an unborn child a human being?
T295	Claim 48688 48825	With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, there's one individual who's not being considered at all
T296	Premise 48827 48862	That's the one who is being aborted
T297	Premise 48868 48938	I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born
T298	Claim 49290 49350	I also think that that unborn child has a right to be wanted
T299	Claim 49356 49533	I also believe, sir, that the most personal intimate decision that any woman is ever called upon to make is the decision as to whether or not she shall carry a pregnancy to term
T300	Claim 49539 49980	for the state to interfere in that decision, under whatever guise, and with whatever rationale, for the state to try to take over in that situation, and by edict, command what the individual shall do, and substitute itself for that individual's conscience, for her right to consult her rabbi, her minister, her priest, her doctor - any other counselor of her choice - I think goes beyond what we want to ever see accomplished in this country
T301	Premise 49982 50025	if we really believe in the First Amendment
T302	Premise 50027 50100	if we really believe in freedom of choice and the right of the individual
T303	Claim 50385 50437	there might be some feeling of unfairness about this
T304	Premise 50446 50472	he was not here to respond
T305	Premise 50222 50379	I would just like to remark a concern that I have that we have criticized the failures of the Carter policy here rather considerably, both of us this evening
T306	Claim 50478 50596	I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate
T307	Premise 50602 50757	I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement
T308	Claim 52826 52846	I still believe that
T309	Claim 52848 52954	I'm not running for the Presidency because I believe that I can solve the problems we've discussed tonight

T311	Claim 53279 53447	President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were confronted with only two choices, with only two men, and with only two parties
T312	Claim 53815 53859	I am running for President as an Independent
T313	Premise 53868 53903	I believe our country is in trouble
T314	Premise 53905 53995	I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems
T315	Claim 54496 54527	I don't think you do think that
T316	Claim 54544 54637	I think you ought to consider doing something about it, and voting for an Independent in 1980
T317	Premise 54649 54759	a generation of office seekers has tried to tell the American people that they could get something for nothing
T318	Premise 54761 54877	It's been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes
T319	Claim 54879 54905	We've got to stop drifting
T320	Claim 55770 55965	Those are some of the great issues - atomic warfare, the use of our natural resources, and the issue of nationalism - that I intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign
T321	Claim 56049 56211	that an Independent government of John Anderson and Patrick Lucey can give us the kind of coalition government that we need in 1980 to begin to solve our problems
T322	Claim 52520 52688	The living Americans today have fought harder, paid a higher price for freedom, and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this earth
T323	Premise 52254 52307	we, the living Americans, have gone through four wars
T324	Premise 52309 52426	We've gone through a Great Depression in our lifetime that literally was worldwide and almost brought us to our knees
T325	Premise 52432 52518	we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness
T326	Claim 53047 53166	We can meet our destiny - and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill
T327	Claim 53449 53551	I think you've seen tonight in this debate that Governor Reagan and I have agreed on exactly one thing
T328	Premise 53554 53611	we are both against the reimposition of a peacetime draft
T329	Premise 53613 53673	We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue
T330	Premise 54907 55045	What I wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important
T331	Premise 55047 55178	A great historian, Henry Steele Commager, said that in their lust for victory, neither traditional party is looking beyond November
T332	Premise 55184 55310	he went on to cite three issues that their platforms totally ignore: atomic warfare, Presidential Directive 59 notwithstanding
T333	Claim 55312 55372	If we don't resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant
T334	Premise 55374 55489	The issue of our natural resources; the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be?
T335	Premise 55490 55768	The issue of nationalism - the recognition, he says, that every major problem confronting us is global, and cannot be solved by nationalism here or elsewhere - that is chauvinistic, that is parochial, that is as anachronistic as states' rights was in the days of Jefferson Davis
