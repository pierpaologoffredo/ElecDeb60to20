T37	Claim 3300 3341	We're saving money to invest in education
T38	Premise 3343 3429	You cannot reform education and improve it in this country without spending some money

T41	Premise 3557 3664	To help local school districts build new buildings so our children are not learning in crumbling classrooms

T43	Premise 3842 3929	that is a tremendous life-saving change which will help people carry on their education
T44	Premise 3934 4035	allow them to develop the kinds of skills that will help them succeed in the hi-tech economy of today
T45	Premise 4529 4652	If you look at our proposal, we take half of the projected surplus and set it aside for Social Security. Over $2.4 trillion
T46	Premise 4654 4806	We take roughly a fourth of it for other urgent priorities such as Medicare reform and education, several of these other key programs we want to support
T47	Premise 4812 4908	we take roughly one-fourth of it and return it in the form of a tax cut to the American taxpayer
T48	Claim 4910 4960	We think it's extraordinarily important to do that
T49	Claim 4962 5019	It is a fundamental difference between our two approaches
T50	Premise 5021 5335	If you look, frankly, by our numbers and the numbers of the Senate Budget Committee, which has totaled up all the promises that Vice President Gore has made during the course of the campaign, they are some $900 billion in spending over and above that surplus already and we still have a month to go in the campaign
T51	Claim 5337 5415	The fact is that the program that we put together we think is very responsible
T52	Premise 5417 5483	Suggestion that somehow all of it is going for tax cuts isn't true

T59	Premise 6052 6098	It is their choice and it is their prerogative
T60	Claim 6100 6233	We want to give them the opportunity to make those kinds of choices for themselves and we think this is a totally reasonable approach
T61	Premise 6294 6473	With all due respect, the Senate Budget Committee estimates that Dick Cheney has just referred to are the estimates of the partisan Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee
T62	Premise 6475 6555	We're using the numbers presented by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office
T63	Claim 6557 6682	We start with an agreement which is this surplus in the Social Security fund should be locked up and used for Social Security
T64	Claim 6684 6715	That's where the agreement ends
T65	Claim 6717 6882	We also agree and believe and pledge that the surplus in the Medicare trust fund should also be locked up with a sign on it that says politicians keep your hands off
T66	Claim 6883 6911	Our opponents do not do that
T67	Premise 6913 7074	In fact, they raid the Medicare trust fund to pay for, well, their tax cut and other programs that they can't afford because they've spent so much on the tax cut
T68	Premise 7151 7274	The numbers show that $1.6 trillion goes to the big tax cut which, as Al Gore said the other night, sends 43% to the top 1%
T69	Premise 7276 7483	Worse than that, when you add on the other spending programs that our opponents have committed to, plus the cost of their plan to privatize Social Security, by our calculations they're $1.1 trillion in debt.
T70	Claim 7484 7625	That means we go back down the road to higher interest rates, to higher unemployment, to a kind of self-tax increase on every American family
T71	Premise 7635 7758	when interest rates go up, so, too, do the cost of mortgage payments, car payments, student loans, credit card transactions
T72	Claim 7763 7965	if we've learned anything over the last eight years, it is that one of the most important things the government can do, the federal government, probably the most important, is to be fiscally responsible
T73	Claim 7982 8044	Al Gore and I are committed to balancing the budget every year
T74	Premise 8055 8192	the paying off the debt by the year 2012, when by our calculation our opponent's economic plan still leaves America $2.8 trillion in debt
