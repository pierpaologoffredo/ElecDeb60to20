T101	Claim 1817 2047	I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 - and I worked hard for it and supported it - we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living
T102	Premise 2053 2245	today, on the average, the average serviceman is at least 15% - and I happen to think that's a very modest estimate - 15% below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time
T103	Premise 2251 2333	as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today
T104	Claim 2339 2362	I think that's shocking
T105	Claim 2364 2377	it's shameful
T106	Claim 2506 2595	I outlined a very specific program of increasing pay and allowances, reenlistment bonuses
T107	Claim 2959 3003	I would not leave this country go undefended
T108	Premise 2735 2946	to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances
T109	Claim 813 892	I am well aware of the present deficiencies in the Armed Forces of this country
T110	Premise 899 1203	you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country - Continental United States Army Divisions - simply could not pass a readiness test: that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the so-called Rapid Deployment Force could not meet a readiness test
T111	Premise 1209 1358	in most cases, that failure to meet the test was because of a lack of manning requirements, an inability to fill many of the slots in those divisions
T112	Premise 1365 1528	I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980 - this very month - that there is a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9
T113	Premise 1534 1656	there were reports. public reports not long ago about ships that could not leave American ports because of a lack of crews
T114	Premise 1658 1810	I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short
T115	Claim 3430 3490	it's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating
T116	Premise 3500 3586	the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement on this particular issue
T117	Premise 3592 3674	the only one who would be disagreeing with us is the President, if he were present
T118	Claim 3676 3717	I. too, believe in the voluntary military
T119	Premise 3740 3926	today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldn't have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees
T120	Claim 3928 4064	I believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country, when we want it to work
T121	Premise 4066 4109	Recognize that we have a voluntary military
T122	Premise 4111 4247	We are asking for men and women to join the military as a career, and we're asking them to deal with the most sophisticated of equipment
T123	Premise 4253 4574	a young man is out there on a $1 billion carrier in charge of the maintenance of a $20 million aircraft, working 100 hours a week at times, and he's earning less for himself and his family, while he's away from his family, than he could earn if he were in one of the most menial jobs, working 40 hours a week here at home
T124	Claim 4898 4989	That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up
T125	Premise 4576 4755	As an aid to enlistment. we had an aid - 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I. Bill of Rights
T126	Premise 4758 4850	the fact that, by serving in the military, they could provide for a future college education
T127	Premise 4852 4896	In 1977, we took that away from the military
T128	Claim 4994 5027	I think it is a case of pay scale
T129	Claim 5032 5289	recognizing that if we're going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven's sakes, let's go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we're asking of them
T130	Claim 5308 5375	I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate
T131	Premise 5377 5529	We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instant's notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment
T132	Claim 5531 5634	Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people
T133	Claim 5959 6103	I think I have better opportunity, however, of finding the necessary funds to pay what, admittedly, will be very, very substantial sums of money
T134	Premise 6105 6250	We signed one bill. or we passed one bill, just a couple of weeks ago in the House of Representatives for $500 million - a half a billion dollars
T135	Premise 6252 6293	That is just a downpayment, in my opinion
T136	Claim 6324 6373	I do not support a boondoggle like the MX missile
T137	Premise 6375 6509	I've just gotten a report from the Air Force that indicates that the 30-year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be $100 billion
T138	Premise 6511 6772	The initial cost is about $54 billion, and then when you add in the additional costs - not only the construction of the system, the missiles and the personnel, and so on - when you add in the additional costs over the lifecycle of that system, over $100 billion
T139	Claim 6774 6863	I would propose to save the taxpayers of this country from that kind of costly boondoggle
T140	Claim 7489 7508	We need the missile
T141	Premise 7527 7618	we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault
T142	Claim 7624 7671	I am not in favor of the plan that is so costly
T143	Claim 6964 7018	I happen to support and believe in the missile, itself
T144	Premise 7024 7082	that's not the $54 billion cost that John is talking about
T145	Premise 7084 7218	He's talking about that fantastic plan of the Administration to take thousands and thousands of square miles out in the Western states
T146	Premise 7224 7356	first, he was going to dig a racetrack and have it going around in the racetrack so it would meet the requirements of SALT II treaty
T147	Premise 7362 7487	now he's decided it'll have a straight up and down thing, so it can he both verifiable and yet hideable from the Soviet Union
