T383	Claim 205 237	they're both extremely dangerous
T388	Claim 500 563	Iran getting a nuclear weapon would be very, very destabilizing
T389	Claim 586 659	they are not close to getting a nuclear weapon that's able to be deployed
T390	Claim 661 691	So they're both very dangerous
T391	Claim 693 725	They both would be game changers
T392	Claim 825 905	John continues to tell us that the central war in the front on terror is in Iraq
T385	Premise 350 386	Pakistan already has nuclear weapons
T387	Premise 388 433	Pakistan already has deployed nuclear weapons

T395	Premise 1122 1143	That's where they are
T396	Premise 1145 1175	That's where it will come from
T397	Premise 1177 1215	And right now that resides in Pakistan
T398	Claim 1217 1260	A stable government needs to be established
T399	Claim 1262 1403	We need to support that democracy by helping them not only with their military but with their governance as well as their economic well-being
T400	Premise 1404 1459	There have been 7,000 madrasses built along that border

T404	Claim 1666 1718	we will go at him if we have actionable intelligence
T405	Claim 1827 1866	Both are extremely dangerous, of course
T406	Claim 1872 1968	as for who termed that central war on terror being in Iraq, it was General Petraeus and al Qaeda
T407	Claim 1993 2057	it's probably the only thing that they're ever going to agree on
T408	Claim 2111 2162	You don't have to believe me or John McCain on that
T409	Claim 2217 2295	An armed, nuclear armed especially, Iran is so extremely dangerous to consider
T410	Claim 2297 2353	They cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons period
T411	Claim 2355 2442	Israel is in jeopardy of course when we're dealing with Ahmadinejad as a leader of Iran
T412	Premise 2444 2563	Iran claiming that Israel is, he termed it, a stinking corpse, a country that should be wiped off the face of the earth
T413	Claim 2569 2722	a leader like Ahmadinejad who is not sane or stable when he says things like that is not one whom we can allow to acquire nuclear energy, nuclear weapons
T414	Claim 2914 3019	An issue like that taken up by a presidential candidate goes beyond naivete and goes beyond poor judgment
T415	Claim 3021 3078	A statement that he made like that is downright dangerous
T416	Premise 3080 3311	because leaders like Ahmadinejad who would seek to acquire nuclear weapons and wipe off the face of the earth an ally like we have in Israel should not be met with without preconditions and diplomatic efforts being undertaken first
T417	Claim 3564 3602	No, and Dr. Henry Kissinger especially
T418	Claim 3703 3757	And that's what John McCain and I would engage in also
T420	Claim 4087 4114	That is beyond bad judgment
T421	Claim 4116 4133	That is dangerous
T422	Claim 4134 4165	No, diplomacy is very important
T423	Claim 4167 4218	First and foremost, that is what we would engage in
T424	Claim 4220 4264	But diplomacy is hard work by serious people
T425	Premise 4266 4365	It's lining out clear objectives and having your friends and your allies ready to back you up there
T426	Premise 4366 4454	and have sanctions lined up also before any kind of presidential summit would take place
T427	Claim 4502 4548	That's just simply not true about Barack Obama
T428	Claim 4550 4590	He did not say sit down with Ahmadinejad
T429	Claim 4627 4743	it surprises me that Senator McCain doesn't realize that Ahmadinejad does not control the security apparatus in Iran
T430	Claim 4745 4790	The theocracy controls the security apparatus
T431	Premise 4815 4881	five secretaries of state did say we should talk with and sit down
T432	Premise 5064 5140	Our friends and allies have been saying, Gwen, "Sit down. Talk. Talk. Talk."
T433	Premise 5141 5239	Our friends and allies have been saying that, five secretaries of state, three of them Republicans
T434	Claim 5241 5327	And John McCain has said he would go along with an agreement, but he wouldn't sit down
T435	Premise 5431 5463	And look what President Bush did
T436	Premise 5465 5619	After five years, he finally sent a high-ranking diplomat to meet with the highest-ranking diplomats in Iran, in Europe, to try to work out an arrangement
T437	Claim 5621 5653	Our allies are on that same page
T438	Premise 5655 5759	And if we don't go the extra mile on diplomacy, what makes you think the allies are going to sit with us
T439	Premise 5787 5951	John McCain said as recently as a couple of weeks ago he wouldn't even sit down with the government of Spain, a NATO ally that has troops in Afghanistan with us now
T440	Claim 5953 5975	I find that incredible
T441	Claim 6274 6310	A two-state solution is the solution
T442	Claim 6490 6511	that needs to be done
T443	Claim 6517 6594	that will be top of an agenda item, also, under a McCain-Palin administration
T444	Claim 6595 6651	Israel is our strongest and best ally in the Middle East
T445	Claim 6653 6723	We have got to assure them that we will never allow a second Holocaust
T446	Claim 6859 6881	We will support Israel

T449	Premise 7118 7144	They succeeded with Jordan
T450	Premise 7146 7171	They succeeded with Egypt
T451	Claim 7173 7230	I'm sure that we're going to see more success there, also
T452	Claim 7232 7299	It's got to be a commitment of the United States of America, though
T453	Claim 7305 7417	I can promise you, in a McCain-Palin administration, that commitment is there to work with our friends in Israel
T454	Claim 7451 7535	no one in the United States Senate has been a better friend to Israel than Joe Biden
T455	Claim 7537 7638	I would have never, ever joined this ticket were I not absolutely sure Barack Obama shared my passion
T456	Claim 7758 7817	It has been an abject failure, this administration's policy
T457	Claim 7819 7914	In fairness to Secretary Rice, she's trying to turn it around now in the seventh or eighth year
T458	Premise 8041 8114	Barack Obama said, "Big mistake. Hamas will win. You'll legitimize them."
T459	Premise 8130 8139	Hamas won
T460	Claim 8502 8562	the policy of this administration has been an abject failure
T461	Premise 8141 8353	When we kicked -- along with France, we kicked Hezbollah out of Lebanon, I said and Barack said, "Move NATO forces in there. Fill the vacuum, because if you don't know -- if you don't, Hezbollah will control it."
T462	Premise 8375 8473	Hezbollah is a legitimate part of the government in the country immediately to the north of Israel
T463	Claim 8564 8643	And speaking of freedom being on the march, the only thing on the march is Iran
T464	Claim 8645 8666	It's closer to a bomb
T465	Premise 8668 8754	Its proxies now have a major stake in Lebanon, as well as in the Gaza Strip with Hamas
T466	Claim 8756 8990	We will change this policy with thoughtful, real, live diplomacy that understands that you must back Israel in letting them negotiate, support their negotiation, and stand with them, not insist on policies like this administration has
T467	Claim 9096 9133	No, I do not believe that it has been
T468	Claim 9139 9242	I'm so encouraged to know that we both love Israel, and I think that is a good thing to get to agree on
T469	Claim 9291 9518	No, in fact, when we talk about the Bush administration, there's a time, too, when Americans are going to say, "Enough is enough with your ticket," on constantly looking backwards, and pointing fingers, and doing the blame game
T470	Claim 9664 9844	But for a ticket that wants to talk about change and looking into the future, there's just too much finger-pointing backwards to ever make us believe that that's where you're going
T471	Claim 9520 9560	There have been huge blunders in the war
T472	Claim 9562 9662	There have been huge blunders throughout this administration, as there are with every administration
T473	Claim 9846 9879	Positive change is coming, though
T474	Claim 9881 9911	Reform of government is coming
T475	Claim 9913 9996	We'll learn from the past mistakes in this administration and other administrations
T476	Claim 9998 10128	And we're going to forge ahead with putting government back on the side of the people and making sure that our country comes first
T477	Claim 10168 10229	That's what John McCain has been known for in all these years
T478	Claim 10231 10255	He has been the maverick
T479	Claim 10257 10280	He has ruffled feathers
T480	Claim 10384 10404	But change is coming
T481	Claim 10286 10340	I know, Senator Biden, you have respected him for that
T482	Claim 10570 10598	I haven't heard anything yet
T483	Claim 10599 10681	I haven't heard how his policy is going to be different on Iran than George Bush's
T484	Claim 10683 10769	I haven't heard how his policy is going to be different with Israel than George Bush's
T485	Claim 10771 10860	I haven't heard how his policy in Afghanistan is going to be different than George Bush's
T486	Claim 10862 10948	I haven't heard how his policy in Pakistan is going to be different than George Bush's
T487	Claim 10950 10959	It may be
T488	Claim 10961 11004	But so far, it is the same as George Bush's
T489	Claim 11051 11143	We will make significant change so, once again, we're the most respected nation in the world
T490	Claim 11145 11174	That's what we're going to do
T491	Claim 11479 11563	those dangerous regimes, again, cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons, period
T492	Claim 11564 11624	Our nuclear weaponry here in the U.S. is used as a deterrent
T493	Claim 11626 11679	And that's a safe, stable way to use nuclear weaponry
T494	Premise 11361 11474	Nuclear weaponry, of course, would be the be all, end all of just too many people in too many parts of our planet
T495	Claim 11681 11891	But for those countries -- North Korea, also, under Kim Jong-il -- we have got to make sure that we're putting the economic sanctions on these countries and that we have friends and allies supporting us in this
T496	Premise 11892 12026	to make sure that leaders like Kim Jong-il and Ahmadinejad are not allowed to acquire, to proliferate, or to use those nuclear weapons
T497	Claim 12028 12048	It is that important
T498	Claim 12340 12479	The surge principles, not the exact strategy, but the surge principles that have worked in Iraq need to be implemented in Afghanistan, also
T499	Claim 12481 12550	And that, perhaps, would be a difference with the Bush administration
T500	Claim 12662 12742	And such a reckless, reckless comment and untrue comment, again, hurts our cause
T501	Claim 12744 12777	That's not what we're doing there
T502	Claim 12779 12932	We're fighting terrorists, and we're securing democracy, and we're building schools for children there so that there is opportunity in that country, also
T503	Claim 12934 13014	There will be a big difference there, and we will win in -- in Afghanistan, also
T504	Premise 13339 13492	our commanding general in Afghanistan said the surge principle in Iraq will not work in Afghanistan, not Joe Biden, our commanding general in Afghanistan
T505	Premise 13494 13521	He said we need more troops
T506	Claim 13523 13550	We need government-building
T507	Claim 13552 13616	We need to spend more money on the infrastructure in Afghanistan
T508	Premise 13618 13813	Look, we have spent more money -- we spend more money in three weeks on combat in Iraq than we spent on the entirety of the last seven years that we have been in Afghanistan building that country
T509	Claim 14001 14054	nuclear weapons require a nuclear arms control regime
T510	Premise 14056 14157	John McCain voted against a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty that every Republican has supported
T511	Premise 14159 14262	John McCain has opposed amending the Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty with an amendment to allow for inspections
T513	Premise 14400 14655	Barack Obama, first thing he did when he came to the United States Senate, new senator, reached across the aisle to my colleague, Dick Lugar, a Republican, and said, "We've got to do something about keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists."
T514	Premise 14656 14732	They put together a piece of legislation that, in fact, was serious and real
T515	Claim 14808 14898	I know that John McCain has been opposed to extending the arms control regime in the world
T516	Claim 14927 15025	Well, first, McClellan did not say definitively the surge principles would not work in Afghanistan
T517	Premise 15027 15138	Certainly, accounting for different conditions in that different country and conditions are certainly different
T518	Premise 15140 15178	We have NATO allies helping us for one
T519	Claim 15228 15286	the counterinsurgency principles could work in Afghanistan
T520	Premise 15288 15334	McClellan didn't say anything opposite of that
T521	Claim 15336 15486	The counterinsurgency strategy going into Afghanistan, clearing, holding, rebuilding, the civil society and the infrastructure can work in Afghanistan
T522	Premise 15488 15615	And those leaders who are over there, who have also been advising George Bush on this have not said anything different but that
T523	Claim 15648 15683	our commanding general did say that
T525	Premise 16064 16188	Again, we spend in three weeks on combat missions in Iraq, more than we spent in the entire time we have been in Afghanistan
T526	Claim 16190 16239	That will change in a Barack Obama administration
