T220	Claim 28575 28608	There are ways to help people now
T221	Claim 28623 28755	ways that we're offering are not being supported by -- by the Bush administration nor do I believe by John McCain and Governor Palin
T222	Claim 28802 28816	That is not so
T223	Claim 29085 29185	we have to consider the need to do all that we can to allow this nation to become energy independent
T224	Claim 29187 29229	It's a nonsensical position that we are in
T225	Premise 29230 29295	when we have domestic supplies of energy all over this great land
T226	Premise 29301 29410	East Coast politicians who don't allow energy-producing states like Alaska to produce these, to tap into them
T227	Premise 29416 29476	instead we're relying on foreign countries to produce for us
T228	Premise 29487 29553	We're circulating about $700 billion a year into foreign countries
T229	Claim 29587 29640	they certainly don't have our best interests at heart
T230	Claim 29836 29944	Energy independence is the key to this nation's future, to our economic future, and to our national security
T231	Premise 29644 29835	instead of those dollars circulating here, creating tens of thousands of jobs and allowing domestic supplies of energy to be tapped into and start flowing into these very, very hungry markets
T232	Claim 29949 30036	when we talk about energy plans, it's not just about who got a tax break and who didn't
T233	Claim 30042 30130	we're not giving oil companies tax breaks, but it's about a heck of a lot more than that
T234	Claim 30132 30182	Energy independence is the key to America's future
T235	Claim 30512 30588	Alaska feels and sees impacts of climate change more so than any other state

T238	Claim 30702 30818	There is something to be said also for man's activities, but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet
T239	Claim 30820 30870	But there are real changes going on in our climate
T240	Claim 31011 31046	We have got to clean up this planet
T241	Claim 31048 31148	We have got to encourage other nations also to come along with us with the impacts of climate change

T243	Claim 31287 31316	We've got to reduce emissions
T244	Premise 31318 31416	John McCain is right there with an "all of the above" approach to deal with climate change impacts
T245	Claim 31418 31472	We've got to become energy independent for that reason
T246	Premise 31479 31673	as we rely more and more on other countries that don't care as much about the climate as we do, we're allowing them to produce and to emit and even pollute more than America would ever stand for
T247	Claim 31678 31903	even in dealing with climate change, it's all the more reason that we have an "all of the above" approach, tapping into alternative sources of energy and conserving fuel, conserving our petroleum products and our hydrocarbons
T248	Premise 31904 31968	so that we can clean up this planet and deal with climate change
T249	Claim 32051 32072	I think it is manmade
T250	Claim 32074 32102	I think it's clearly manmade
T251	Claim 32104 32271	And, look, this probably explains the biggest fundamental difference between John McCain and Barack Obama and Sarah Palin and Joe Biden -- Governor Palin and Joe Biden
T252	Premise 32272 32367	If you don't understand what the cause is, it's virtually impossible to come up with a solution
T253	Claim 32369 32394	We know what the cause is
T254	Claim 32396 32416	The cause is manmade
T255	Claim 32418 32434	That's the cause
T256	Claim 32436 32474	That's why the polar icecap is melting
T257	Premise 32600 32748	John McCain has voted 20 times in the last decade-and-a-half against funding alternative energy sources, clean energy sources, wind, solar, biofuels
T258	Premise 32750 32813	The way in which we can stop the greenhouse gases from emitting
T259	Premise 32506 32551	We have 3 percent of the world's oil reserves
T260	Premise 32553 32598	We consume 25 percent of the oil in the world
T261	Claim 32829 32894	Barack Obama believes by investing in clean coal and safe nuclear
T262	Claim 32896 32985	we can not only create jobs in wind and solar here in the United States, we can export it
T263	Premise 32987 33067	China is building one to three new coal-fired plants burning dirty coal per week
T264	Premise 33069 33147	It's polluting not only the atmosphere but the West Coast of the United States
T265	Claim 33149 33218	We should export the technology by investing in clean coal technology
T266	Claim 33220 33246	We should be creating jobs
T267	Premise 33248 33321	John McCain has voted 20 times against funding alternative energy sources
T268	Premise 33334 33381	I guess, the only answer is drill, drill, drill
T269	Claim 33383 33396	Drill we must
T270	Premise 33398 33513	but it will take 10 years for one drop of oil to come out of any of the wells that are going to begun to be drilled
T271	Claim 33515 33569	In the meantime, we're all going to be in real trouble
T272	Claim 33782 33808	I have always supported it
T273	Claim 33911 33948	Yes, Senator McCain does support this
T274	Claim 33810 33823	That's a fact
T275	Claim 33950 33982	The chant is "drill, baby, drill
T276	Claim 33989 34047	that's what we hear all across this country in our rallies
T277	Premise 34048 34131	because people are so hungry for those domestic sources of energy to be tapped into
T278	Premise 34133 34288	They know that even in my own energy-producing state we have billions of barrels of oil and hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of clean, green natural gas
T279	Premise 34290 34486	And we're building a nearly $40 billion natural gas pipeline which is North America's largest and most you expensive infrastructure project ever to flow those sources of energy into hungry markets
T280	Claim 34487 34620	Barack Obama and Senator Biden, you've said no to everything in trying to find a domestic solution to the energy crisis that we're in
T281	Premise 34622 34736	You even called drilling -- safe, environmentally-friendly drilling offshore as raping the outer continental shelf
T282	Claim 34738 34853	There -- with new technology, with tiny footprints even on land, it is safe to drill and we need to do more of that
T283	Claim 34855 35000	But also in that "all of the above" approach that Senator McCain supports, the alternative fuels will be tapped into: the nuclear, the clean coal
T284	Claim 35002 35042	I was surprised to hear you mention that
T285	Premise 35043 35119	because you had said that there isn't anything -- such a thing as clean coal
T286	Premise 35125 35188	I think you said it in a rope line, too, at one of your rallies
T287	Claim 35321 35325	I do
T288	Claim 35327 35331	I do
T289	Claim 35596 35654	My record for 25 years has supported clean coal technology
T290	Claim 35656 35710	A comment made in a rope line was taken out of context
T291	Claim 35712 35766	I was talking about exporting that technology to China
T292	Premise 35767 35841	so when they burn their dirty coal, it won't be as dirty, it will be clean
T293	Premise 36012 36052	the governor says John is for everything
T294	Claim 36088 36166	Maybe he's for everything as long as it's not helped forward by the government
T295	Claim 36168 36229	Maybe he's for everything if the free market takes care of it
T296	Premise 36245 36309	But he voted 20 times against funding alternative energy sources
T297	Claim 36497 36507	Absolutely
T298	Claim 36550 36571	Absolutely positively
T299	Claim 36579 36752	in an Obama-Biden administration, there will be absolutely no distinction from a constitutional standpoint or a legal standpoint between a same-sex and a heterosexual couple
T300	Claim 36753 36970	The fact of the matter is that under the Constitution we should be granted -- same-sex couples should be able to have visitation rights in the hospitals, joint ownership of property, life insurance policies, et cetera
T301	Claim 36972 36988	That's only fair
T302	Premise 36990 37026	It's what the Constitution calls for
T303	Claim 37032 37051	so we do support it
T304	Claim 37053 37320	We do support making sure that committed couples in a same-sex marriage are guaranteed the same constitutional benefits as it relates to their property rights, their rights of visitation, their rights to insurance, their rights of ownership as heterosexual couples do
T305	Claim 37429 37549	not if it goes closer and closer towards redefining the traditional definition of marriage between one man and one woman
T306	Claim 37555 37608	unfortunately that's sometimes where those steps lead
T307	Claim 37637 37859	if there's any kind of suggestion at all from my answer that I would be anything but tolerant of adults in America choosing their partners, choosing relationships that they deem best for themselves, you know, I am tolerant
T308	Premise 37864 38061	I have a very diverse family and group of friends and even within that group you would see some who may not agree with me on this issue, some very dear friends who don't agree with me on this issue
T309	Claim 38063 38268	But in that tolerance also, no one would ever propose, not in a McCain-Palin administration, to do anything to prohibit, say, visitations in a hospital or contracts being signed, negotiated between parties
T310	Claim 38313 38478	I don't support defining marriage as anything but between one man and one woman, and I think through nuances we can go round and round about what that actually means
T311	Claim 38484 38605	I'm being as straight up with Americans as I can in my non- support for anything but a traditional definition of marriage
T312	Claim 38652 38679	Do you support gay marriage
T313	Claim 38689 38691	No
T314	Claim 38693 38774	Barack Obama nor I support redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage
T315	Claim 38776 38798	We do not support that
T316	Premise 38800 38945	That is basically the decision to be able to be able to be left to faiths and people who practice their faiths the determination what you call it
T317	Claim 38977 39186	I'm glad to hear the governor, I take her at her word, obviously, that she think there should be no civil rights distinction, none whatsoever, between a committed gay couple and a committed heterosexual couple
T318	Claim 39188 39241	If that's the case, we really don't have a difference
T319	Claim 39284 39399	Your question to him was whether he supported gay marriage and my answer is the same as his and it is that I do not
T320	Claim 39692 39819	I am very thankful that we do have a good plan and the surge and the counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq that has proven to work
T321	Claim 39821 39986	I am thankful that that is part of the plan implemented under a great American hero, General Petraeus, and pushed hard by another great American, Senator John McCain
T322	Claim 39987 40104	I know that the other ticket opposed this surge, in fact, even opposed funding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan
T323	Premise 40106 40193	Barack Obama voted against funding troops there after promising that he would not do so
T324	Claim 40223 40270	I respected you when you called him out on that
T325	Premise 40272 40341	You said that his vote was political and you said it would cost lives
T326	Premise 40343 40394	And Barack Obama at first said he would not do that
T327	Claim 40396 40437	He turned around under political pressure
T328	Premise 40442 40477	he voted against funding the troops
T329	Claim 40479 40511	We do have a plan for withdrawal
T330	Claim 40513 40555	We don't need early withdrawal out of Iraq
T331	Claim 40557 40655	We cannot afford to lose there or we're going to be no better off in the war in Afghanistan either
T332	Claim 40657 40683	We have got to win in Iraq
T333	Premise 40688 40761	with the surge that has worked we're now down to presurge numbers in Iraq
T334	Claim 40763 40785	That's where we can be
T335	Claim 40787 40834	We can start putting more troops in Afghanistan
T336	Premise 40838 40902	we also work with our NATO allies who are there strengthening us

T339	Premise 41047 41089	we're getting closer and closer to victory
T340	Claim 41091 41140	And it would be a travesty if we quit now in Iraq
T341	Claim 41448 41519	The only odd man out here, only one left out is John McCain, number one
T342	Claim 41196 41216	I didn't hear a plan

T348	Claim 41637 41772	John McCain voted against funding the troops because of an amendment he voted against had a timeline in it to draw down American troops
T349	Premise 41778 41850	John said I'm not going to fund the troops if in fact there's a timeline
T350	Claim 41852 42005	Barack Obama and I agree fully and completely on one thing: You've got to have a time line to draw down the troops and shift responsibility to the Iraqis
T351	Premise 42006 42085	We're spending $10 billion a month while the Iraqis have an $80 billion surplus
T352	Claim 42308 42373	this is a fundamental difference between us, we will end this war
T353	Claim 42375 42455	For John McCain, there's no end in sight to end this war, fundamental difference
T354	Claim 42457 42477	We will end this war
T355	Claim 42087 42291	Barack says it's time for them to spend their own money and have the 400,000 military weâ€™ve trained for them begin to take their own responsibility and gradually over six months -- 16 months, withdrawal
T356	Claim 42506 42620	Your plan is a white flag of surrender in Iraq and that is not what our troops need to hear today, that's for sure
T357	Claim 42622 42679	And it's not what our nation needs to be able to count on
T358	Claim 42681 42707	You guys opposed the surge
T359	Claim 42709 42725	The surge worked
T360	Claim 42727 42773	Barack Obama still can't admit the surge works
T361	Claim 42774 42917	We'll know when we're finished in Iraq when the Iraqi government can govern its people and when the Iraqi security forces can secure its people
T362	Claim 42919 43000	And our commanders on the ground will tell us when those conditions have been met
T363	Premise 43155 43276	Now, you said regarding Senator McCain's military policies there, Senator Biden, that you supported a lot of these things
T364	Premise 43278 43374	In fact, you said in fact that you wanted to run, you'd be honored to run with him on the ticket

T367	Premise 43565 43657	I know again that you opposed the move that he made to try to cut off funding for the troops

T388	Claim 45667 45730	Iran getting a nuclear weapon would be very, very destabilizing
T389	Claim 45753 45826	they are not close to getting a nuclear weapon that's able to be deployed
T390	Claim 45828 45858	So they're both very dangerous

T414	Claim 48081 48186	An issue like that taken up by a presidential candidate goes beyond naivete and goes beyond poor judgment
T415	Claim 48188 48245	A statement that he made like that is downright dangerous
T416	Premise 48247 48478	because leaders like Ahmadinejad who would seek to acquire nuclear weapons and wipe off the face of the earth an ally like we have in Israel should not be met with without preconditions and diplomatic efforts being undertaken first
T417	Claim 48731 48769	No, and Dr. Henry Kissinger especially
T418	Claim 48870 48924	And that's what John McCain and I would engage in also

T422	Claim 49301 49332	No, diplomacy is very important
T423	Claim 49334 49385	First and foremost, that is what we would engage in

T470	Claim 54831 55011	But for a ticket that wants to talk about change and looking into the future, there's just too much finger-pointing backwards to ever make us believe that that's where you're going

T495	Claim 56848 57058	But for those countries -- North Korea, also, under Kim Jong-il -- we have got to make sure that we're putting the economic sanctions on these countries and that we have friends and allies supporting us in this
T496	Premise 57059 57193	to make sure that leaders like Kim Jong-il and Ahmadinejad are not allowed to acquire, to proliferate, or to use those nuclear weapons

T499	Claim 57648 57717	And that, perhaps, would be a difference with the Bush administration

T501	Claim 57911 57944	That's not what we're doing there

T515	Claim 59975 60065	I know that John McCain has been opposed to extending the arms control regime in the world
T516	Claim 60094 60192	Well, first, McClellan did not say definitively the surge principles would not work in Afghanistan

T520	Premise 60455 60501	McClellan didn't say anything opposite of that
T521	Claim 60503 60653	The counterinsurgency strategy going into Afghanistan, clearing, holding, rebuilding, the civil society and the infrastructure can work in Afghanistan
T522	Premise 60655 60782	And those leaders who are over there, who have also been advising George Bush on this have not said anything different but that
T523	Claim 60815 60850	our commanding general did say that
T524	Premise 60920 61229	while Barack and I and Chuck Hagel and Dick Lugar have been calling for more money to help in Afghanistan, more troops in Afghanistan, John McCain was saying two years ago quote, "The reason we don't read about Afghanistan anymore in the paper, it's succeeded.Barack Obama was saying we need more troops there

T527	Claim 61735 61790	I think the American public has the stomach for success
T528	Premise 61906 61975	And initially John McCain opposed it along with a lot of other people

T545	Claim 63130 63319	We should rally the world to act and we should demonstrate it by our own movement to provide the helicopters to get the 21,000 forces of the African Union in there now to stop this genocide

T564	Claim 65288 65523	When a country engages in genocide, when a country engaging in harboring terrorists and will do nothing about it, at that point that country in my view and Barack's view forfeits their right to say you have no right to intervene at all
