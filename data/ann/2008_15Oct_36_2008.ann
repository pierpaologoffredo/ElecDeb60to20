T581	Claim 64795 64823	That's not appropriate to do

T595	Premise 65825 65875	This is a very important issue we're talking about
T596	Premise 65673 65823	Not because I agreed with their ideology, but because I thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated
T597	Premise 65624 65671	I voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg
T598	Premise 65529 65622	You chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, "conservative judges."

T602	Claim 66473 66520	I would consider anyone in their qualifications
T603	Claim 66522 66624	I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be part of those qualifications
T604	Claim 66630 66674	I certainly would not impose any litmus test
T605	Claim 66713 66890	I think it's true that we shouldn't apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people
T606	Claim 66896 67003	it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president
T607	Premise 67005 67155	It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance

T612	Claim 67581 67685	I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldn't be subject to state referendum
T613	Premise 67687 67759	any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum
T614	Premise 67761 67846	any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote
T615	Claim 67860 67898	this is going to be an important issue
T616	Claim 67900 67968	I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record
T617	Claim 67970 67992	who have the intellect
T618	Claim 67998 68067	who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through
T619	Premise 68069 68105	I'll just give you one quick example
T620	Premise 68107 68268	Senator McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination
T621	Premise 68271 68366	For years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job
T622	Premise 68372 68568	when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it's taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didn't know about it until fairly recently
T623	Premise 68571 68608	We tried to overturn it in the Senate
T624	Premise 68610 68699	I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.
T625	Claim 68701 68921	I think that it's important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will
T626	Claim 68927 68963	that's the kind of judge that I want
T627	Claim 69191 69231	We have to change the culture of America
T628	Premise 69233 69285	Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that
T629	Claim 70345 70474	It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America
T630	Claim 70202 70219	that's his record

T635	Premise 69723 69969	Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really -- one of the bad procedures, a terrible
T636	Premise 69975 70040	then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present
T637	Premise 70043 70094	I don't know how you vote "present" on some of that
T638	Premise 70096 70196	I don't know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America
T639	Claim 70642 70655	it's not true
T640	Premise 70536 70625	If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant
T641	Premise 70684 70851	There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade
T642	Premise 70870 70963	there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment
T643	Premise 70965 71051	which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it

T645	Premise 71147 71252	Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books
T646	Claim 71255 71447	With respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there's an exception for the mother's health and life
T647	Premise 71453 71488	this did not contain that exception
T648	Premise 71495 71580	I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional
T649	Premise 71586 71603	that was rejected
T650	Premise 71620 71635	I voted present
T651	Claim 71645 71730	I'm willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception
