T536	Claim 898 994	With regard to Iraq, I indicated that it would be a mistake to -- I gave the president the power
T537	Premise 996 1163	I voted for the power because he said he needed it not to go to war but to keep the United States, the UN in line, to keep sanctions on Iraq and not let them be lifted
