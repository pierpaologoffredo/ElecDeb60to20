T153	Premise 738 1136	The mayors that I've talked to in some of our leading cities tell! me that the Federal grants that come with. for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local government's hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority
T154	Premise 1138 1297	If they had that money without those government restrictions, every one of them has told me they could make great savings and make far greater use of the money
T155	Claim 1299 1487	What I have been advocating is, why don't we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs?

T166	Premise 2431 2514	why don't we offer incentives for business and industry to start up in those zones?
T167	Premise 2515 2586	Give them a tax moratorium for a period if they build and develop there
T168	Premise 2588 2721	The individuals that would then get jobs - give them a break that encourages them to leave the social welfare programs and go to work

T173	Claim 4264 4460	the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America
T174	Premise 4471 4672	first of all, for the creation of a $4 billion urban reinvestment trust fund to do exactly what you spoke about in your question - to rebuild the streets, to rebuild the cities, the leaking water mains
T175	Premise 4674 4854	I was in North Pittsburgh - I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign - the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasn't money available to fix them

T185	Claim 3684 3887	It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America
T186	Premise 3903 4218	just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits

T196	Premise 6686 6717	It just takes - from the people

T203	Claim 7561 7844	It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country
