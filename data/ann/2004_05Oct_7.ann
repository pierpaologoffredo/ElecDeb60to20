T1	Question 58 415	I want to read something you said four years ago at this very setting: "Freedom means freedom for everybody." You said it again recently when you were asked about legalizing same-sex unions. And you used your family's experience as a context for your remarks.  Can you describe then your administration's support for a constitutional ban on same-sex unions?

T21	Question 3097 3349	As the vice president mentioned, John Kerry comes from the state of Massachusetts, which has taken as big a step as any state in the union to legalize gay marriage. Yet both you and Senator Kerry say you oppose it.  Are you trying to have it both ways?
