T19	Premise 2283 2338	We can't afford to give up that opportunity until later
T20	Claim 2344 2502	to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained
T21	Premise 2504 2707	For instance, some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core - below ground level, the entire power plant that uses atomic uh - power tightly sealed and a heavy - heavy vacuum maintained
T22	Premise 2709 2748	There ought to be a standardized design
T23	Premise 2750 2948	There ought to be a full-time uh - atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops
T24	Premise 2950 3057	These kinds of uh - procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated
T25	Premise 3063 3406	shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh - put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions
T26	Claim 3632 3740	Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies
T27	Premise 3742 3854	We uh - now encourage people to waste electricity, and uh - by giving uh - the lowest rates to the biggest users
T28	Premise 3856 3914	We don't do anything to cut down on peak load requirements
T29	Premise 3916 4016	We don't have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles
T30	Premise 4022 4224	whenever the uh - automobile manufacturers come forward and say they can't meet the uh - amendments that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates
T31	Premise 4247 4365	we ought to have a - a shift toward the use of coal, particularly in the Appalachian regions where the coal is located
T32	Premise 4367 4446	A lot of uh - very high quality, low-carbon coal, uh - low-sulfur coal is there
T33	Claim 4448 4483	it's where our employment is needed
T34	Claim 4531 4568	mandatory conservation measures - yes
T35	Claim 4570 4644	Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve - yes
T36	Claim 4655 4761	the private sector ought to be encouraged to - to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency
T37	Premise 4763 4916	One bank in uh - Washington, fo- for instance, gives lower interest loans for people who adequately insulate their homes or who buy efficient automobiles
T38	Premise 4922 5123	some major uh - uh - manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have through uh - very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh - as much as 40 percent with the same out-product
T39	Claim 5293 5359	Governor Carter skims over a very serious and a very broad subject
T40	Premise 5361 5507	In January of uh - 1975 I submitted to the Congress and to the American people the first comprehensive energy program recommended by any president
T41	Premise 5509 5583	It called for an increase in the production of energy in the United States
T42	Premise 5585 5671	It called for uh - conservation measures so that we would save the energy that we have
T43	Premise 5843 6015	I recommended to the Congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel- a- a billion two hundred million tons by 1985
T44	Claim 6017 6094	In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground
T45	Claim 6096 6180	we have to improve our utilization of coal - make it more efficient, make it cleaner
T46	Claim 6182 6245	In addition we uh - have to expand our research and development
T47	Premise 6247 6421	In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year
T48	Premise 6423 6471	We're going as fast as the experts say we should
T49	Premise 6473 6745	In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh - under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh - very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh - nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards
T50	Claim 6747 6903	I think you have to have greater oil and gas production, more coal production, more nuclear production, and in addition you have to have energy conservation
