T134	Premise 18905 19123	by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in
T135	Premise 19162 19334	The President's economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way

T162	Premise 24355 24399	the city isn't getting any tax from that now
T163	Premise 24405 24434	there would simply be a delay

T281	Premise 46827 47034	He has never supported any of those arms control agreements - the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford

T285	Claim 47718 47944	when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation - that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing

T293	Premise 48916 49167	I would say to the Soviet Union, we will sit and negotiate with you as long as it takes, to have not only legitimate arms limitation, but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapons to the point that neither one of us represents a threat to the other
T294	Claim 49169 49243	That is hardly throwing away a treaty and being opposed to arms limitation
T295	Claim 49285 49357	Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements
T296	Premise 49359 49499	He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty - and I don't know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form

T305	Premise 49782 50168	If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition
T306	Claim 51145 51246	with regard to negotiating: it does not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the United States
T307	Premise 51248 51362	It calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other
T308	Claim 51368 51547	to suggest that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous Presidents, is just not true

T408	Premise 65951 66093	when I became President, the action of the Democratic Congress working with me has been to put Social Security back on a sound financial basis
T409	Claim 66165 66185	that just isn't true
T410	Premise 66187 66300	It has, as I said, delayed the actuarial imbalance falling on us for just a few years with that increase in taxes
T411	Claim 66306 66353	I don't believe we can go on increasing the tax
T412	Premise 66363 66474	the problem for the young people today is that they are paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out

T414	Premise 66656 66859	the voluntary thing that I suggested many years ago was that with a young man orphaned and raised by an aunt who died, his aunt was ineligible for Social Security insurance because she was not his mother

T419	Claim 67631 67654	I'd like to change that
T420	Claim 68090 68148	We also need to continue to index Social Security payments
T421	Premise 68150 68306	so that if inflation rises, the Social Security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of a Social Security check continue intact
T422	Claim 67860 67914	It is obvious that we should have a commitment to them
T423	Claim 67916 67965	that Social Security benefits should not be taxed

T433	Premise 69367 69538	I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed
T434	Claim 69601 69655	I was opposing one piece of legislation versus another
T435	Claim 69826 70037	I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness

T437	Claim 70263 70469	I think this debate on Social Security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party

T443	Premise 70626 70832	These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them
T444	Claim 72585 72871	The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations
T445	Claim 72194 72251	there is the historical perspective that I just described
T446	Claim 73279 73481	his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it

T454	Claim 74283 74519	I believe that there is a fundamental difference - and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight - that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program
T455	Claim 74521 74659	I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level
T456	Premise 74661 74716	It has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people
T457	Premise 74722 74884	there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them

T466	Claim 75610 75725	today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today
T467	Premise 75882 75965	It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people
T468	Claim 76129 76262	I don't think that can be better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our nation
