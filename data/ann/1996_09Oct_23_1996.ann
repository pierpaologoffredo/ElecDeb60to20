The Corporations of Engineers, the Bureau of Wildlife and Fisheries, all of the federal agencies came onto his property, declared it a federal wetland and said he couldn't drive.

T366	Premise 54631 54668	There are thousands of other examples
T367	Premise 54711 55077	Let me give you an example from OSHA. We're reinventing the way OSHA does its job. Some people would like to eliminate OSHA.

We found that the inspectors were being rewarded on the basis of how many fines they issued
T368	Premise 55079 55105	We changed that completely
T369	Premise 55107 55459	They used to go in and give somebody a fine if they didn't have a poster on the wall informing employees of their rights.

Now there is technology that would allow infrared technology to be used to identify those cars that are providing or the pollution in our atmosphere. It is not being able to be used because we are going to take every automobile driver in America, all 110 million automobiles, and charge them 17 or 20 or $25
T373	Premise 56177 56465	we ought to go after the ones that pollute, not go after the men and women who want to be able to drive their automobile to work or to school and to make sure that they have the type of opportunity to live like everyone else without having themselves regulated by Washington establishment
T374	Claim 56467 56488	We can use technology

T386	Premise 57466 57657	As long as a woman or man wants to go to work it ought to be their choice, but in America today that woman or man must work in a family to, one to pay the tax and the other to help the family
T387	Claim 57659 57677	That's not America
