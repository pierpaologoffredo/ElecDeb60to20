T49	Claim 848 914	I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself
T50	Claim 916 1008	Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I'm for it
T51	Claim 1014 1098	I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem
T52	Premise 1108 1222	all you're doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply
T53	Premise 1348 1456	The fact is, that in today's oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used
T54	Claim 2452 2483	All of these things can be done
T55	Claim 2867 2993	I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis
T56	Claim 3000 3037	we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation
T57	Claim 1224 1346	To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact
T58	Premise 1462 1555	it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground
T59	Premise 1561 1603	this is known oil reserves, known supplies
T60	Premise 1605 1916	There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago
T61	Premise 1918 2024	We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world's coal supply, good for centuries, in this country
T62	Claim 2038 2059	that prices may go up
T63	Premise 2069 2150	as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production
T64	Premise 2152 2208	We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest
T65	Claim 2210 2450	the most stringent of safety requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible
T66	Premise 2514 2648	we are only drilling on 2%. have leased only 2% of the possible. possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States
T67	Premise 2678 2860	the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources
T68	Claim 3589 3822	I simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by Mr. Reagan, who once again, has demonstrated, I think, a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts, not only this country, but the world
T69	Premise 3829 4056	he suggests that we have 27 years' supply of natural gas, 47 years' supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really. all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and that's going to be enough
T70	Claim 4133 4224	we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people
T71	Premise 4248 4322	I proposed, 15 months ago, the emergency excise tax on gasoline that I did
T72	Claim 4324 4365	I did it as a security measure to be sure
T73	Premise 4375 4496	I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf
T74	Claim 4520 4672	I think it's going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile
T75	Premise 4674 4804	We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities
T76	Claim 4806 4867	We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling
T77	Claim 4869 4939	We're going to have to develop better community transportation systems
T78	Premise 4941 5070	so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient
T79	Claim 5344 5395	there are things that we can do in the retrofitting
T80	Premise 5400 5538	the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve
T81	Premise 5086 5334	with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country
T82	Claim 5794 5898	I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy
T83	Premise 5540 5789	According to one study that was published a short time ago - the Harvard Business School study - indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today
T84	Claim 6841 6926	I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that
T85	Claim 6938 7034	I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found
T86	Claim 5951 5984	I am not an enemy of conservation
T87	Claim 6208 6351	my figures are the figures of the Department of Energy, which has not been overly optimistic in recent years as to how much supply we have left
T88	Premise 6353 6518	That is the same Government that, in 1920, told us we only had enough oil left for 13 years, and 19 years later, told us we only had enough left for another 15 years
T89	Claim 6520 6609	As for saving energy and conserving, the American people haven't been doing badly at that
T90	Premise 6619 6750	in industry today, we're producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973
T91	Premise 6756 6835	motorists are using 8% less than they were back at that time of the oil embargo
T92	Claim 7085 7172	I think my opponent in this debate tonight is overlooking one other very important fact
T93	Claim 7192 7243	we cannot look at this as simply a national problem
T94	Premise 7245 7433	Even though it's true that, perhaps, between now and the end of the decade, our total consumption of oil may not increase by more than, perhaps, a million or 2 million barrels of oil a day
T95	Premise 7435 7555	The rest of the Western world, we are told, may see its consumption increase from 51 million barrels to about 66 million
T96	Claim 7561 7622	that additional 15 million barrels is going to cause scarcity
T97	Claim 7624 7670	It is going to cause scarcity in world markets
T98	Premise 7679 7943	there are at least five reputable studies, one even by the American Petroleum Institute itself, that, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade, total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies
T99	Claim 7973 8023	I think that a change in lifestyles - is necessary
T100	Claim 8029 8087	we had better begin to plan for that now rather than later
