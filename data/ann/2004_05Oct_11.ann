T4	Question 56 422	Flip-flopping has become a recurring theme in this campaign, you may have noticed.  Senator Kerry changed his mind about whether to vote to authorize the president to go to war. President Bush changed his mind about whether a homeland security department was a good idea or a 9/11 Commission was a good idea.  What's wrong with a little flip-flop every now and then?
