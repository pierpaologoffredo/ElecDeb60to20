T2	Claim 2283 2353	I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course
T3	Claim 2355 2382	a course which is difficult
T4	Claim 2387 2674	a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States
T5	Claim 4307 4309	No
T6	Claim 4311 4327	Cuba is not lost
T7	Claim 4333 4421	I don't think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit

T12	Claim 3408 3541	Now I'm very surprised that Senator Kennedy, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, would have made such a statement as this kind
T13	Claim 3543 3626	As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position
T14	Claim 3207 3243	We think that's pretty good progress

T19	Claim 5689 5717	I hope some day it will rise
T20	Claim 5723 5822	I don't think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years
T21	Claim 5921 6092	we've beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh - revolution

T25	Claim 4658 4747	Where I've been critical of the Administration's policy, and where I criticized Mr. Nixon
T26	Claim 5030 5199	What I criticized was the failure of the Administration to use its great influence to persuade the Cuban government to hold free elections, particularly in 1957 and 1958
T27	Claim 5579 5650	we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively
T28	Claim 5541 5577	we never were on the side of freedom

T32	Premise 6377 6536	Mr. Morgan, I suggested that if the United States felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets
T33	Claim 6900 6950	they were not in accordance with international law
T34	Premise 6817 6894	The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security

T36	Claim 7450 7570;7623 7664	The point that is always left out is the fact that we expressed regrets to Castro this winter; that we expressed regrets for a flight over Southern Russia in 1958

T41	Claim 7957 8088	my judgment is that we should follow the advice of Theodore Roosevelt: Be strong; maintain a strong position; but also speak softly
T42	Claim 8090 8225	I believe that in those cases where international custom calls for the expression of a regret, if that would have kept the summit going
T43	Claim 8227 8264	in my judgment it was a proper action

T50	Claim 8511 8634;8702 8826	in my judgment if the summit was useful, if it would have brought us closer to peace, that rather than the lie that we told it would have been far better for us to follow the common diplomatic procedure of expressing regrets and then try to move on
T51	Claim 8921 8957;8966 9065	First of all, he's wrong in thinking even suggesting that Mr. Khrushchev might have continued the conference if we had expressed regrets
T52	Premise 9067 9114	He knew these flights were going on long before
T53	Claim 9119 9173	that wasn't the reason that he broke up the conference

T59	Claim 9968 10004	We cannot afford an intelligence gap
T60	Claim 9836 9897	This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part
T61	Claim 9331 9583	when the president of the United States is doing something that's right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including Mr. Khrushchev

T73	Claim 13168 13222	I do it because we have to solve this problem together

T418	Claim 54209 54288	We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it's attacked

T470	Claim 59205 59215	I never do
T471	Claim 59273 59415	I don't think it's enough for Senator Kennedy to go before the audiences on the Democratic side and say, "Vote for me because I'm a Democrat."

T473	Claim 59435 59510	What's involved here is the question of leadership for the whole free world

T483	Premise 60275 60308	They will move her forward faster
T484	Premise 60314 60364	they will move her more surely than in his program
T485	Claim 60397 60460	I'm sure he believes just as deeply that his will move that way
