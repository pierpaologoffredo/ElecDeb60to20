T239	Premise 31723 31922	The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon- Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state.

T242	Claim 32283 32320	I think we're going to have to do it.
T243	Claim 32325 32597	I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated.

T254	Claim 33647 33725;33795 33846	I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes.
T256	Premise 33867 33903	it will be necessary to raise taxes.
T257	Premise 33904 34072	As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned - the one for medical care for the aged - that that would be financed out of Social Security.

T258	Premise 34140 34238	He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development.
T259	Claim 34245 34302	our natural resources development - which I also support,

T269	Premise 35586 35699	you said - it was back in 1957 - that salaries paid to school teachers were nothing short of a national disgrace.
T270	Premise 35700 35755	Higher salaries for teachers, you added, were important
T271	Premise 35760 35831	if the situation wasn't corrected it could lead to a national disaster.

T273	Premise 35909 35995	that single vote, if it had been yes, would have granted salary increases to teachers.
T274	Claim 36203 36365	I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh - pay teachers' salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy
T275	Premise 36396 36482	in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction,
T276	Premise 36487 36560	at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers' salaries

T282	Claim 37134 37176	I think this would be bad for the country;

T284	Claim 37274 37311	I favor higher salaries for teachers.

T287	Claim 37764 37867	your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should.
T288	Premise 37662 37763	once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers' salaries,
T289	Claim 37868 37986	I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility.
T290	Premise 37987 38136	Teachers' salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries.
T291	Claim 38180 38308	I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program.
T292	Premise 38355 38506	My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education,
T293	Premise 38309 38354	My objection here is not the cost in dollars.
T294	Claim 38665 38744	I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers' salaries,

T299	Premise 39041 39100	I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly
T300	Claim 39110 39220	I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control
T301	Premise 39225 39278	it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed
T302	Premise 39284 39354	his tie vote uh - defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal.

T305	Premise 39431 39465	if the money will go to the states
T306	Premise 39470 39570	the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers' salaries,

T308	Premise 39717 39743	that is why I supported it
T309	Premise 39748 39778	I regret that it did not pass.
T310	Claim 39937 39975	That is wholly wrong, wholly in error,
T311	Claim 40137 40218	That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record.
T312	Premise 39981 40136	t is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars.
T313	Premise 39831 39886	the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money
T314	Premise 39896 39936	I am in favor of unbalancing the budget.
T315	Claim 40219 40260;40300 40324	My view is that you can do these programs within a balanced budget
T316	Premise 40325 40356	if our economy is moving ahead.
T317	Premise 40477 40505	if you are elected president

T320	Premise 41791 41847	we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate.
T322	Premise 41219 41252	the House failed by eleven votes.
T323	Premise 41274 41369	two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage

T321	Claim 41171 41180	It failed
T325	Premise 41189 41214	the House did not pass it
T326	Claim 41544 41667	it's extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it.
T327	Premise 41668 41780	All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one-third plus one in either the House or the Senate.
T328	Claim 41848 41911	It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives.

T335	Premise 42522 42556	Forty-four Democrats voted for it,
T336	Premise 42557 42585	one Republican voted for it.
T337	Premise 42590 42709	we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it.
T338	Claim 42710 42856	In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs.
T339	Claim 42972 43083	in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session, which is a clash of parties and inaction.
T340	Premise 42861 42971	if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress,
T341	Claim 43120 43167	Well obviously my views are a little different.
T342	Premise 43449 43514	there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans.
T343	Claim 43546 43680	it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats' not getting a something through that particular committee.
T344	Claim 43706 43858	to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh - misses the mark.
T345	Premise 43904 43980	he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress.
T346	Claim 44154 44239	why didn't they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue?
T347	Premise 44008 44108	If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues
T348	Claim 44240 44390	The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them;
T349	Claim 44391 44435	it was because the people were against them.
T350	Claim 44436 44473	It was because they were too extreme.
T351	Claim 44763 44804	they could get through the next Congress.
T352	Premise 44645 44666	they are not extreme,
T353	Premise 44675 44757	they will accomplish the end uh - without too great cost in dollars or in freedom,
T354	Claim 45129 45209	we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate.
T355	Premise 45215 45304	We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh - in this election.
T356	Premise 45305 45346	We cannot, of course, control the Senate.
T357	Claim 45364 45533	a president will be able to lead - a president will be able to get his program through - to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people.
T358	Claim 45701 45722	It isn't really that.
T359	Premise 45723 45816	Whenever a majority of the people are for a program, the House and the Senate responds to it.

T361	Premise 45901 46008	if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made,
T362	Claim 46331 46429	You must always remember that a president can't stop anything unless he has the people behind him.
T363	Premise 46434 46688	the reason President Eisenhower's vetoes have been sustained - the reason the Congress does not send up bills to him which they think will be vetoed - is because the people and the Congress, the majority of them, know the country is behind the President.
T364	Premise 46811 46951	One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business.
T365	Claim 46952 46988	I don't think that's extreme at all;
T366	Premise 46993 47111	yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal.
T367	Claim 47184 47282	because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh - met in my opinion the need.
T368	Premise 47309 47400	it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal.
T369	Claim 47401 47427	It was not an extreme bill
T370	Premise 47432 47476	yet we could not get one Republican to join,
T371	Claim 47486 47648	I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it.
T372	Claim 47649 47718	I don't say the Democrats are united in their support of the program.
T373	Claim 47723 47747	I do say a majority are.
T374	Claim 47752 47806	I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it.
T375	Claim 48251 48307	I think it shows the difference between the two parties.
T376	Claim 47928 47970	It does not put a deficit on the Treasury.
T377	Premise 47971 48065	The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars
T378	Premise 48068 48196	Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didn't agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security.
T379	Claim 48308 48353	One party is ready to move in these programs.
T380	Claim 48354 48393	The other party gives them lip service.
T381	Claim 48759 48789	Well, I think they're serious.

T388	Claim 49273 49320	The major threat is external and will continue.
T389	Claim 49357 49424	I agree with Senator Kennedy's appraisal generally in this respect.
T390	Premise 49425 49521	The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past.
T391	Premise 49522 49585	It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come.
T392	Premise 49586 49760	We have to remember that the cold war that Mr. Khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging, is waged all over the world and it's waged right here in the United States.
T393	Claim 49761 49804	That's why we have to continue to be alert.
T394	Claim 49805 49857	It is also essential in being alert that we be fair;
T395	Premise 49858 49947	fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy.
T396	Premise 49948 50013	We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow.
T397	Claim 50039 50409	I think that uh - we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh - the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon.
T398	Claim 50510 50698	I do believe that he uh - would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his.
T399	Claim 52409 52452	That is the growth that we are looking for;
T400	Claim 52453 52547	it is the growth that this Administration has supported and that its policies have stimulated.
T401	Claim 52393 52408	that is growth.
T402	Premise 52194 52251	this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise;
T403	Premise 52256 52388	it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight-year period.
T404	Claim 52589 52861	I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools.
T405	Claim 52872 52908	I think we have a rich uh - country.
T406	Claim 52913 52948	I think we have a powerful country.
T407	Claim 52949 53093	I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade,
T408	Premise 53094 53204	if we're going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources.
T410	Claim 53570 53662	I think that's the big assignment, the big task, the big function of the federal government.
T411	Claim 53376 53569	I want to compare what we're doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength.
T409	Claim 54084 54212	I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth

T413	Premise 54304 54338	They start from a much lower base.
T414	Premise 54423 54533	today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product.
T415	Premise 54534 54590	That's the same percentage that it was twenty years ago.
T416	Claim 54636 54718	we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago.
T417	Premise 54774 54799	these are determined men.
T418	Premise 54800 54823	They are fanatical men.
T419	Premise 54828 54893	we have to get the very most of uh - out uh - out of our economy.
T420	Claim 54894 54948	I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score.
T421	Claim 54949 55036	Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy.
T422	Premise 55064 55200	Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth.
T423	Claim 55201 55536	I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated.
T424	Premise 55670 55897	Our health program - the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported - is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it.
T425	Premise 55898 55978	It provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance.
T426	Premise 55983 56040	it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it.
T427	Premise 56041 56188	His program under Social Security, would require everybody who had Social Security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not.
T428	Premise 56193 56281	it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all.
