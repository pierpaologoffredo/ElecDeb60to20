T883	Premise 2979 3045	I helped double the NIH budget to $28 billion a year to find cures
T884	Claim 3051 3127	the approach I took is one that I think is a balanced and necessary approach
T885	Premise 3129 3173	to balance science and the concerns for life
T886	Claim 3804 3859	We've got to open up the possibilities of this research
T887	Claim 3865 3904	when I am president, I'm going to do it
T889	Premise 3486 3801	the lines of stem cells that he's made available, every scientist in the country will tell you, "Not adequate," because they're contaminated by mouse cells, and because there aren't 60 or 70 -- they're are only about 11 to 20 now -- and there aren't enough to be able to do the research because they're contaminated

T2	Premise 623 779	I was at a forum with Michael J. Fox the other day in New Hampshire, who's suffering from Parkinson's, and he wants us to do stem cell, embryonic stem cell.

T4	Premise 829 912	His whole body was shaking from the nerve disease, the muscular disease that he had
T5	Premise 915 1041	And he said to me and to the whole hall, he said, "You know, don't take away my hope, because my hope is what keeps me going."
