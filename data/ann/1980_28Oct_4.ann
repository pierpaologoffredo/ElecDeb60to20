T223	Premise 1409 1513	I and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons
T224	Premise 2007 2065	This ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all
T225	Claim 2071 2161	it's part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds
T226	Claim 1723 1807	When Governor Reagan has been asked about that, he makes the very disturbing comment
T227	Premise 1813 1904	non-proliferation, or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons, is none of our business

T232	Premise 2830 3178	When I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of the taking of our hostages, I announced then, and have consistently maintained since then, that if the hostages are released safely, we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns - which they have bought and paid for - also, that the frozen Iranian assets would be released
T233	Claim 4341 4487	I think that anyone that's seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, what about this, what about that?

T238	Claim 5086 5122	Your question is difficult to answer
T239	Premise 5133 5353	in the situation right now, no one wants to say anything that would inadvertently delay, in any way, the return of those hostages if there if there is a chance that they're coming home soon, or that might cause them harm
T240	Claim -1 343; -1 343	What I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families, and that tragedy is over - then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they came home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about
T241	Claim 5808 5871	I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation
T242	Premise 4788 4927	I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages

T245	Premise 6975 7275	someone didn't meet exactly our standards of human rights, even though they were an ally of ours, instead of trying patiently to persuade them to change their ways, we have, in a number of instances, aided a revolutionary overthrow which results in complete totalitarianism, instead, for those people
T246	Claim 7277 7329	I think that this is a kind of a hypocritical policy
