T290	Claim 187 270	you do believe, deep down, that we are heading for some kind of biblical Armageddon
T291	Premise 272 386	Your Pentagon and your Secretary of Defense have plans for the United States to fight and prevail in a nuclear war
T292	Premise 574 772	I think what has been hailed as something I'm supposedly, as President, discussing as principle is the recall of just some philosophical discussions with people who are interested in the same things
T293	Premise 778 909	that is the prophecies down through the years, the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of Armageddon, and so forth
T294	Premise 915 1072	the fact that a number of theologians for the last decade or more have believed that this was true, that the prophecies are coming together that portend that
T295	Premise 1078 1195	no one knows whether Armageddon, those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow
T296	Claim 1201 1276	I have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to Armageddon
T297	Claim 1375 1393	of course we would
T298	Claim 1560 1612	A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought
T299	Premise 1618 1797	that is why we are maintaining a deterrent and trying to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage
T300	Premise 1804 1927	the deterrent -- and that's what it is for -- is also what led me to propose what is now being called the Star Wars concept
T302	Premise 2883 2992	There has never been a weapon invented in the history of man that has not led to a defensive, a counterweapon
T304	Premise 3201 3467	why not do what I have offered to do and asked the Soviet Union to do? Say, "Look, here's what we can do. We'll even give it to you. Now, will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid, all of us, of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat?''
T305	Claim 3468 3528	I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon
T306	Premise 3811 3966	let me sharply disagree with the President on sharing the most advanced, the most dangerous, the most important technology in America with the Soviet Union
T308	Premise 3968 4087	We have had for many years, understandably, a system of restraints on high technology because the Soviets are behind us
T309	Premise 4093 4232	any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering
T310	Claim 4337 4398	I would not let the Soviet Union get their hands on it at all
T311	Claim 4434 4477	There's nothing wrong with the theory of it
T312	Premise 4479 4620	If we could develop a principle that would say both sides could fire all their missiles and no one would get hurt, I suppose it's a good idea
T314	Claim 4913 4987	It would cost something like a trillion dollars to test and deploy weapons
T315	Claim 4990 5068	The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldn't respond in kind
T316	Premise 5074 5088	they always do
T317	Premise 5090 5109	We don't get behind
T318	Premise 5111 5132	They won't get behind
T319	Claim 5185 5239	We have more at stake in space satellites than they do
T321	Claim 5501 5666	to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race that's very dangerous indeed
T322	Claim 5686 5825	The most dangerous aspect of this proposal is, for the first time, we would delegate to computers the decision as to whether to start a war
T323	Claim 5827 5844	That's dead wrong
T324	Premise 5846 5894	There wouldn't be time for a President to decide
T325	Premise 5896 5941	it would be decided by these remote computers
T326	Premise 5943 6052	It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it's a missile -- and off we go
T327	Premise 6343 6460	the basis of your arms proposals, as I understand them, is a mutual and verifiable freeze on existing weapons systems
T328	Claim 6590 6685	Every system that is verifiable should be placed on the table for negotiations for an agreement
T329	Premise 6687 6829	I would not agree to any negotiations or any agreement that involved conduct on the part of the Soviet Union that we couldn't verify every day
T330	Premise 6831 6949	I would not agree to any agreement in which the United States security interest was not fully recognized and supported
T331	Claim 7042 7107	this ever-rising arms race madness makes both nations less secure
T332	Claim 7109 7150	It's more difficult to defend this nation
T333	Claim 7152 7194	It's putting a hair-trigger on nuclear war
T334	Premise 7196 7295	This administration, by going into the Star Wars system, is going to add a dangerous new escalation
T335	Claim -1 77; -1 77	I think the American people and the people of the Soviet Union want it to stop
T336	Premise 7573 8148	this invention that has just been created here of how I would go about rolling over for the Soviet Union -- no, Mr. Mondale, my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with them and then say, "Now, are you willing to join us? Here's what we'' -- give them a demonstration and then say -- "Here's what we can do. Now, if you're willing to join us in getting rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world, then we'll give you this one, so that we would both know that no one can cheat; that we're both got something that if anyone tries to cheat . . . .''
T337	Claim 8186 8244	I never suggested where the weapons should be or what kind
T338	Premise 8246 8265	I'm not a scientist
T339	Premise 8267 8434	I said, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed with me, that it was time for us to turn our research ability to seeing if we could not find this kind of defensive weapon
T340	Premise 8436 8528	And suddenly somebody says, "Oh, it's got to be up there, and it's Star Wars,'' and so forth
T341	Claim 8530 8629	I don't know what it would be, but if we can come up with one, I think the world will be better off
T342	Claim 8685 8766	that's what a President's supposed to know -- where those weapons are going to be
T343	Claim 8929 8982	this is the most dangerous technology that we possess
T344	Premise 8984 9030	The Soviets try to spy on us, steal this stuff
T345	Claim 9032 9089	And to give them technology of this kind, I disagree with
T346	Claim 9091 9140	You haven't just accepted research, Mr. President
T347	Claim 9322 9348	This is an arms escalation
T348	Claim 9354 9413	we will be better off, far better off, if we stop right now
T349	Premise 9423 9465	we have more to lose in space then they do
T350	Premise 9467 9537	If someday, somebody comes along with an answer, that's something else
T351	Premise 9543 9604	that there would be an answer in our lifetime is unimaginable
T352	Claim 9695 9724	That's what a President's for
T301	Claim 2391 2469	you would share this very super-sophisticated technology with the Soviet Union
T307	Claim 6309 6335	A nuclear freeze is a hoax
T573	Premise 1933 2042	propose that we research to see if there isn't a defensive weapon that could defend against incoming missiles
T303	Claim 3061 3089	that would make war imminent
T574	Premise 3099 3151	they would think that we could launch a first strike
T575	Premise 3160 3193	we could defend against the enemy
T320	Premise 5241 5436	If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons -- and the President's proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldn't have any argument
T576	Premise 5446 5493	maybe someday, somebody will think of something
T577	Premise 9142 9197	You've set up a Strategic Defense Initiative, an agency
T578	Premise 9199 9223	you're beginning to test
T579	Premise 9225 9255	you're talking about deploying
T580	Premise 9257 9320	you're asking for a budget of some $30 billion for this purpose
