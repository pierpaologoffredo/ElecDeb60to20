T173	Premise 18818 19083	the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow

T264	Premise 28972 29035	Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission
T265	Premise 29043 29225	that's how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts
T266	Premise 29378 29545	when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue?
T267	Premise 29550 29560	he said no

T271	Claim 30024 30075	that is not a right strategy for us to move forward
T272	Claim 30213 30267	Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that

T316	Claim 33647 33697	this is not just when it comes to individual taxes

T319	Premise 33911 34016	Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don't get

T321	Premise 34140 34179	Why wouldn't we want to eliminate that?
T322	Premise 34180 34236	Why wouldn't we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets?
T323	Claim 34253 34356	if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it
T324	Claim 34587 34614	I want to do the same thing

T326	Premise 34359 34578	When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions -- he hasn't identified which ones they are -- but that thereby bring down the corporate rate

T342	Premise 35580 35610	if we're asking for no revenue
T343	Claim 35686 35851	the magnitude of the tax cuts that you're talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow
T344	Premise 35854 36004	As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking about potentially a 30 -- a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time
T345	Premise 36022 36110	that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper
T346	Claim 36209 36229	that's a big problem
T347	Premise 36116 36207	if we're talking about a family who's got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid
T348	Premise 36236 36258	governors are creative
T349	Premise 36260 36285	There's no doubt about it
T350	Claim 36291 36382	they're not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid
T351	Claim 36384 36445	What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help
T352	Claim 36937 36956	It's time to end it
T353	Claim 37776 37823	this is not the kind of policy you want to have
T354	Premise 37824 37864	if you want to get America energy secure
T355	Claim 38113 38192	the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case
T356	Premise 36733 36821	the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year
T357	Premise 36827 36919	it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's been in place for a hundred years
T358	Claim 37182 37267	this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth
T359	Premise 36971 37044	in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world
T360	Premise 37051 37141	I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives
T361	Premise 37294 37391	if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table
T362	Premise 37393 37420	Of course it's on the table
T363	Premise 37422 37495	That's probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent
T364	Premise 37501 37640	don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1
T365	Premise 37867 37950	The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas

T369	Claim 38417 38654	I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best
T370	Premise 38661 38806	I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that
T371	Premise 38808 38947	We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor
T372	Premise 38974 39086	one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy
T373	Claim 39088 39229	Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have
T374	Claim 39231 39249	Let states do this
T375	Premise 39269 39359	if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them
T376	Claim 39414 39523	the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government
T377	Claim 39877 39950	I suspect that, on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position
T378	Premise 39952 39989	Social Security is structurally sound
T379	Claim 39991 40101	It's going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker -- Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill
T380	Premise 40116 40144	the basic structure is sound
T381	Claim 40264 40311	that's the big driver of our deficits right now
T382	Claim 40933 41009	that's the perspective I bring when I think about what's called entitlements
T383	Claim 40712 40791	the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare
T384	Premise 40793 40926	She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go

T393	Premise 41021 41096	the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks
T394	Premise 41098 41153	These are folks who've worked hard, like my grandmother
T395	Premise 41159 41222	there are millions of people out there who are counting on this
T396	Claim 41958 42038	the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs
T397	Claim 42085 42192	you don't need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future
T398	Premise 41783 41952	we were also able to make a -- make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the -- throughout the system
T399	Premise 41671 41777	using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600
T400	Premise 41510 41665	$716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren't overpaying providers
T401	Premise 41315 41508	in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we're going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let's look where some of the money's going
T402	Claim 41236 41310	my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term?
T403	Claim 42381 42521	anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something's going to happen that's going to change their life for the worse
T404	Premise 42332 42368	our seniors depend on these programs
T405	Claim 42541 42675	neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare
T406	Claim 42680 42752	if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further
T407	Claim 42759 42839	for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring
T408	Claim 42893 42979	I was wrong when I said the president isn't proposing any changes for current retirees
T409	Premise 42981 43006	In fact he is on Medicare
T410	Premise 43008 43035	On Social Security he's not
T411	Premise 43042 43119	on Medicare, for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program
T412	Premise 43126 43175	he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers
T413	Premise 43186 43320	just going to them and saying, "We're going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody's going to get a lower rate."
T414	Claim 43321 43375	That's not just going after places where there's abuse
T415	Claim 43377 43414	That's saying we're cutting the rates
T416	Premise 43416 43528	Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won't take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario
T417	Premise 43531 43612	We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients
T418	Claim 43623 43703	we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage
T419	Premise 43704 43741	because of those $716 billion in cuts
T420	Premise 43842 43937	you point out, well, we're putting some back. We're going to give a better prescription program
T421	Premise 43939 43986	That's $1 -- that's $1 for every $15 you've cut
T422	Premise 43988 44040	They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade
T423	Claim 44043 44116	I want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare
T424	Claim 44130 44192	we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it
T425	Claim 44199 44329	the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake
T426	Claim 44336 44479	with regards to young people coming along, I've got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question
T427	Claim 44528 44641	I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future
T428	Claim 44647 44725	the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program
T429	Premise 44727 44754	It's called premium support
T430	Premise 44760 44799	it's understood to be a voucher program
T431	Claim 44867 44874	I don't
T432	Premise 45126 45333	The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance
T433	Claim 45455 45509	this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year
T434	Premise 45356 45431	because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation
T435	Premise 45517 45615	in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it
T436	Claim 45621 45644	there's still a problem
T437	Premise 45654 45772	what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors
T438	Premise 45774 45838	They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare
T439	Premise 45844 45969	every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what'll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse
T440	Claim 46155 46201	I don't think vouchers are the right way to go

T655	Premise 68270 68452	As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be
T656	Premise 68454 68554	Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe
T657	Premise 68557 68583	This is the private market
T658	Premise 68604 68694	these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs

T660	Premise 68785 68869	I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people
T661	Claim 68872 69013	In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have
T662	Claim 69015 69208	We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down

T664	Premise 69232 69278	Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well
T665	Premise 69280 69343	Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others

T667	Claim 69558 69584	That's the wrong way to go
T668	Claim 69586 69651	The private market and individual responsibility always work best

T672	Premise 69854 69962	Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions
T673	Claim 70021 70272	What your plan does is to duplicate what's already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if you've -- if it's been under 90 days
T674	Premise 70279 70301	that's already the law
T675	Claim 70306 70384	that doesn't help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions
T676	Premise 70386 70467	There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts
T677	Claim 70469 70515	It wasn't a government takeover of health care
T678	Claim 70517 70566	It was the largest expansion of private insurance
T679	Premise 70572 70638	what it does say is that "insurers, you've got to take everybody."
T680	Premise 70645 70691	that also means that you've got more customers
T681	Premise 70705 70817	when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something, but can't detail how it will be in fact replaced
T682	Premise 70833 70877	he set up the system he did in Massachusetts
T683	Claim 70890 70965	there isn't a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem

T689	Premise 71277 71424	He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry
T690	Claim 71707 71887	The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices
T691	Claim 71893 72006	the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country
T692	Claim 71703 71705	No
T693	Claim 72641 72664	Those are my principles
T694	Claim 72666 72727	I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families
T695	Claim 72733 72850	I'm going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what -- what are the various ways we could bring down deductions
T696	Claim 72289 72380	What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago
T697	Premise 72130 72287	which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and -- and lay down a piece of legislation and say, "It's my way or the highway," I don't get a lot done
T698	Premise 72382 72471	When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster
T699	Premise 72556 72639	You've said the same thing, you're going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base
T700	Premise 72514 72554	He said he was going to broaden the base
T701	Premise 72473 72512	He said he was going to lower tax rates
T702	Claim 73200 73358	There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth
T703	Premise 73094 73198	One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way
T704	Premise 73062 73092	That's one way one could do it
T705	Premise 73010 73060	then that number disappears for high-income people
T706	Premise 72959 73004	Anybody can have deductions up to that amount
T707	Premise 72923 72957	Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000

T712	Premise 73705 73729	I said that at that time
T713	Claim 73732 73967	The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy

T722	Premise 75495 75569	if all Americans are getting opportunity, we're all going to be better off
T723	Claim 75571 75609	That doesn't restrict people's freedom
T724	Claim 75611 75627	That enhances it
T725	Claim 75636 75704	what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles
