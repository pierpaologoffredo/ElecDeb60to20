T264	Claim 1301 1376	I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival
T265	Claim 2207 2354	I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader

T269	Premise 1487 1637	Our Government, in its most sacred documents - the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and all - speak of man being created, of a Creator
T270	Premise 1639 1668	That we're a nation under God
T271	Premise 1675 1826	I have thought for a long time that too many of our churches have been too reluctant to speak up in behalf of what they believe is proper in Government

T274	Claim 2862 3046	to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state
T275	Premise 2713 2782	certainly the church has the right to take a position on moral issues
T276	Claim 3154 3252	I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual
T277	Premise 3053 3152	Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion
T278	Premise 3258 3499	for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of

T282	Premise 3505 3790	he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges - that only judges that hold a certain, quote, "view," on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government
T283	Claim 4322 4460	for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong
T284	Claim 3998 4062	On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago
T286	Premise 4470 4645	not once, but twice - in 1971 - I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools
T287	Premise 4647 4833	I think mother ought to whisper to Johnny and to Susie, as they button their coats in the morning and leave for the classroom, "Be sure to say a prayer before you start your day's work."

T294	Premise 5734 5807	if we would determine once and for all, is an unborn child a human being?
T295	Claim 5267 5404	With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, there's one individual who's not being considered at all
T296	Premise 5406 5441	That's the one who is being aborted
T297	Premise 5447 5517	I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born
T298	Claim 5869 5929	I also think that that unborn child has a right to be wanted
T299	Claim 5935 6112	I also believe, sir, that the most personal intimate decision that any woman is ever called upon to make is the decision as to whether or not she shall carry a pregnancy to term
T300	Claim 6118 6559	for the state to interfere in that decision, under whatever guise, and with whatever rationale, for the state to try to take over in that situation, and by edict, command what the individual shall do, and substitute itself for that individual's conscience, for her right to consult her rabbi, her minister, her priest, her doctor - any other counselor of her choice - I think goes beyond what we want to ever see accomplished in this country

T302	Premise 6606 6679	if we really believe in freedom of choice and the right of the individual
T1	Claim 969 1272	I don't think there's any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which we've abandoned so much in this country
