T220	Claim 135 294	our number one foreign policy problem today is one that remains almost totally unrecognized: massive illegal immigration from economically collapsing countries
T221	Claim 317 384	it is the only real territorial threat to the American nation-state
T222	Claim 692 715	it has to be dealt with
T223	Claim 717 927	I object to that part of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill which I think is very unfair and would prove to be so. That is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of an employee before they're hired
T224	Premise 929 1105	I'm convinced that the result of this would be that people who are Hispanic, people who have different languages or speak with an accent, would find it difficult to be employed
T225	Claim 1107 1127	I think that's wrong
T226	Premise 1129 1184	We've never had citizenship tests in our country before
T227	Claim 1245 1270	That is counterproductive
T228	Premise 1272 1372	I do support the other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill that strengthen enforcement at the border
T229	Premise 1585 1674	I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done
T231	Premise 1729 1808	strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers
T232	Premise 1817 1899	do so in a way that's responsible and within the Constitution of the United States
T233	Claim 1901 1934	We need an answer to this problem
T234	Premise 2020 2085	Everyone in this room, practically, here tonight, is an immigrant
T235	Premise 2087 2182	We came here loving this nation, serving it, and it has served all of our most bountiful dreams
T236	Premise 2184 2218	And one of those dreams is justice
T239	Claim 2454 2497	We cannot solve this problem all on our own
T238	Claim 2392 2452	maintain and improve relations with our friends to the south
T241	Claim 2978 3040	there will be no immigration reform without employer sanctions
T242	Premise 3050 3080	it would be an unbalanced bill
T243	Premise 3086 3128	there would be simply no way to enforce it
T245	Claim 3851 3889	I'm not doing it for political reasons
T246	Premise 3786 3846	the polls show that the majority of Hispanics want that bill
T247	Claim 3891 3903	I'm doing it
T248	Premise 4079 4206	This bill imposes upon employers the responsibility of determining whether somebody who applies for a job is an American or not
T249	Premise 4208 4310	And just inevitably, they're going to be reluctant to hire Hispanics or people with a different accent
T250	Premise 4312 4394	If I were dealing with politics here, the polls show the American people want this
T251	Claim 4396 4424	I am for reform in this area
T252	Premise 4570 4619	despite the politics of it, I stand where I stand
T253	Claim 4625 4642	I think I'm right
T254	Claim 4648 4790	before this fight is over we're going to come up with a better bill, a more effective bill that does not undermine the liberties of our people
T255	Claim 4841 4871	our borders are out of control
T256	Premise 4877 5111	this fall you allowed the Simpson-Mazzoli bill -- which would at least have minimally protected our borders and the rights of citizenship -- because of a relatively unimportant issue of reimbursement to the States for legalized aliens
T257	Claim 5343 5446	we, believe me, supported the Simpson-Mazzoli bill strongly -- and the bill that came out of the Senate
T258	Premise 5457 5542	there were things added in in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill
T259	Premise 5565 5583	made it a bad bill
T260	Premise 5585 5772	And in conference -- we stayed with them in conference all the way to where even Senator Simpson did not want the bill in the manner in which it would come out of the conference committee
T261	Claim 5774 5836	There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill
T263	Premise 5925 6027	It is also true that this has been a situation on our borders back through a number of administrations
T264	Claim 6805 6882	We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free
T265	Premise 6056 6204	I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally
T267	Premise 6397 6803	there is another employer that we shouldn't be so concerned about, and these are employers down through the years who have encouraged the illegal entry into this country because they then hire these individuals and hire them at starvation wages and with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country, and the individuals can't complain because of their illegal status
T268	Claim 6978 7178	I'm going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders
T270	Premise 7372 7522	as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment, they are going to seek that employment across our borders
T271	Premise 7528 7562	we work with those other countries
T272	Claim 7614 7731	the situation today is terribly different quantitatively -- qualitatively different from what it has been in the past
T275	Claim 8284 8392	the population explosion, if you look at the actual figures, has been vastly exaggerated -- over exaggerated
T276	Premise 8415 8551	there are some pretty scientific and solid figures about how much space there still is in the world and how many more people we can have
T277	Premise 8553 8707	It's almost like going back to the Malthusian theory, when even then they were saying that everyone would starve with the limited population they had then
T278	Claim 8713 8790	the problem of population growth is one, here, with regard to our immigration
T279	Premise 8796 9005	we have been the safety valve, whether we wanted to or not, with the illegal entry here, in Mexico, where their population is increasing and they don't have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs
T280	Claim 9011 9151	this is what we're trying to work out, not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem
T281	Claim 9200 9402	One of the biggest problems today is that the countries to our south are so desperately poor that these people who will almost lose their lives if they don't come north, come north despite all the risks
T282	Premise 9472 9673	it goes to American economic and trade policies that permit these nations to have a chance to get on their own two feet and to get prosperity, so that they can have jobs for themselves and their people
T283	Claim 9690 9808	this enormous national debt, engineered by this administration, is harming these countries in fueling this immigration
T284	Premise 9810 9941	These high interest rates -- real rates that have doubled under this administration -- have had the same effect on Mexico and so on
T285	Claim 10065 10120	that drives our friends to the south up into our region
T286	Claim 10362 10390	it has nothing to do with it
T287	Claim 10587 10639	I predict it'll be coming down a little more shortly
T288	Premise 10396 10581	with regard to these high interest rates, too, at least give us the recognition of the fact that when you left office, Mr. Mondale, they were 21\1/2\ -- the prime rate. It's now 12\1/4\
T289	Claim 10645 10713	we're trying to undo some of the things that your administration did
T200	Claim 2224 2367	we need a measure -- and I will support a measure -- that brings about those objectives but avoids that one aspect that I think is very serious
T237	Premise 2503 2804	that's why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a good-faith way with Mexico, with Costa Rica, with the other nations in trying to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in Central America has undermined our capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well
T240	Premise 7789 7886	Mexico's population will go from about 60 million today to 120 million at the turn of the century
T439	Premise 7888 7986	Many of these people will be coming into the United States not as citizens, but as illegal workers
T490	Premise 386 463	You, yourself, said in the 1970's that we had a "hemorrhage on our borders.''
T500	Claim 1190 1243	I don't think we should have a citizenship card today
T218	Premise 464 578	Yet today you have backed off any immigration reform, such as the balanced and highly crafted Simpson-Mazzoli bill
T559	Premise 641 686	This is a very serious problem in our country
T560	Premise 1374 1455	strengthen other ways of dealing with undocumented workers in this difficult area
T561	Premise 1460 1582	dealing with the problem of settling people who have lived here for many, many years and do not have an established status
T562	Claim 1940 2017	it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process
T564	Claim 3354 3416	who actually do not represent what the Hispanic-Americans want
T565	Premise 3426 3498	polls show that they overwhelmingly want some kind of immigration reform
T566	Premise 3912 3975	all my life I've fought for a system of justice in this country
T567	Premise 3977 4077	a system in which every American has a chance to achieve the fullness in life without discrimination
T568	Claim 4426 4461	for tough enforcement at the border
T569	Claim 4467 4517	for many other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill
T570	Premise 4523 4564	all my life I've fought for a fair nation
T269	Claim 7268 7366	no administration that I know has established the relationship that we have with our Latin friends
T571	Premise 7732 7773	because of the gigantic population growth
T273	Premise 9947 10059	the cost of repaying those debts is so enormous that it results in massive unemployment, hardship, and heartache
T572	Claim 10126 10163	we need to end those deficits as well
T1	Premise 1691 1726	strengthen enforcement at the borde
T2	Claim 8259 8261	No
