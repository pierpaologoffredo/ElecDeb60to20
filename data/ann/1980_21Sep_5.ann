T211	Premise 1278 1537	When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver
T212	Premise 1545 1573	we've seen what has happened
T213	Claim 1575 1646	We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised
T214	Premise 1648 1749	we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term

T216	Claim 2009 2084	I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan
T217	Premise 1850 1990	nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - that's about 18% on an annualized basis - what it's going to be
T218	Premise 2086 2331	His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information
T219	Premise 2333 2381	He went so far as to call it "brutal economics."
T220	Claim 3101 3247	I'm going to wait until I see that that inflation rate is going down, before I even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that I've talked about
T221	Claim 3253 3399	I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending
T222	Premise 2518 2615	I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done
T223	Premise 2632 2671	it's gotten to be about $122 difference
T224	Claim 2673 2695	Somebody worked it out
T225	Premise 2701 2882	they figured out that between the tax cut that Governor Reagan is promising the American people, and the tax cut that Jimmy Carter is promising in 198I, his is worth about $122 more

T227	Claim 2887 2992	you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes
T228	Claim 3787 3802	I don't have to
T229	Claim 3804 3816	I've done it
T230	Premise 3818 3930	We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures
T231	Premise 3932 4071	And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committee's projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5%
T232	Claim 4074 4128	which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated
T233	Premise 4134 4279	eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how. how well it could be done
T234	Claim 4895 4935	I speak with some confidence of our plan
T235	Premise 4945 5110	I took over a state - California - 10% of the population of this nation - a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world
T236	Claim 5116 5149	that state we controlled spending
T237	Claim 5151 5198	We cut the rate of increase in spending in half
T238	Premise 5204 5317	at the same time, we gave back to the people of California - in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts - $5.7 billion
T239	Claim 5795 5847	I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983
T240	Premise 5853 5999	it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that's what he's counting on for his plan
T241	Premise 6005 6179	he's going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget
T242	Claim 6181 6270	We believe that that's too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people
T243	Premise 5319 5373	I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned
T244	Claim 5379 5443	among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending
T245	Premise 5449 5667	the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment
T246	Claim 5669 5712	We have considered inflation in our figures
T247	Premise 5714 5793	We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative
T248	Claim 6593 6717	Spending, in other words. more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government
T249	Premise 6426 6591	despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office
T250	Claim 7303 7428	I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military
T251	Claim 7434 7504	I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up
T252	Premise 6723 6981	on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans
T253	Premise 7574 7634	some people look up figures, and some people make up figures
T254	Claim 7640 7691	John has just made up some very interesting figures
T255	Premise 7693 7729	We took the Senate report, of course
T256	Claim 7735 7892	we did factor in our own ideas with regard to increases in the projected military spending that we believe would, over a period of time, do what is necessary

T259	Claim 7977 8020	we did cut the increase in spending in half

T262	Premise 8435 8538	we only increased the size of Government one-twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years
T263	Premise 8544 8729	one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt
T1	Claim 1151 1277	I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver.
T2	Premise 1067 1141	to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it's going to cost
T3	Claim 2407 2516	I have been very careful in saying that what I'm going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first
