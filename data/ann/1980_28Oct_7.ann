T389	Claim 722 754	It is actuarially out of balance
T391	Claim 1726 1789	I believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis
T392	Claim 1682 1720	They must continue to get those checks
T393	Premise 1795 1838	it's going to take some study and some work
T394	Premise 1844 1942	not just passing a tax increase to let the load - or the roof - fall in on the next administration
T395	Claim 1143 1216	What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts
T396	Premise 1217 1454	to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on Social Security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check
T397	Premise 760 847	this first became evident about 16 years ago, and some of us were voicing warnings then
T398	Premise 849 895	Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance
T399	Premise 901 1141	the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history - the payroll tax increase for Social Security - which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most
T400	Premise 1456 1680	We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens - leave them thinking that in some way, they're endangered and they would have no place to turn
T401	Claim 2434 2586	As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable Social Security System, free of the threat of bankruptcy
T402	Claim 3044 3217	These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age
T403	Premise 2800 3042	in The Wall Street Journal early this week, that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making Social Security more sound by reducing the adjustment in Social Security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation
T404	Claim 3223 3316	no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way
T405	Claim 3579 3607	That is the way it will stay
T406	Premise 2588 2733	Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system
T407	Premise 3331 3430	there was a serious threat to the Social Security System and its integrity during the 1976 campaign
T408	Premise 3435 3577	when I became President, the action of the Democratic Congress working with me has been to put Social Security back on a sound financial basis
T409	Claim 3649 3669	that just isn't true
T410	Premise 3671 3784	It has, as I said, delayed the actuarial imbalance falling on us for just a few years with that increase in taxes
T411	Claim 3790 3837	I don't believe we can go on increasing the tax
T412	Premise 3847 3958	the problem for the young people today is that they are paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out
T413	Claim 4349 4479	I suggested that if this is an insurance program, certainly the person who is paying in should be able to name his own beneficiary
T414	Premise 4140 4343	the voluntary thing that I suggested many years ago was that with a young man orphaned and raised by an aunt who died, his aunt was ineligible for Social Security insurance because she was not his mother
T415	Claim 4481 4560	That is the closest I have ever come to anything voluntary with Social Security
T416	Claim 4562 4709	I, too, am pledged to a Social Security program that will reassure these senior citizens of ours that they are going to continue to get their money
T417	Claim 4711 4759	There are some changes that I would like to make
T418	Premise 4761 5113	I would like to make a change in the regulation that discriminates against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her father's or her husband's benefits, if he dies first, or what she has paid in; but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself, and she is entitled to more than she presently can get
T419	Claim 5115 5138	I'd like to change that
T420	Claim 5574 5632	We also need to continue to index Social Security payments
T421	Premise 5634 5790	so that if inflation rises, the Social Security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of a Social Security check continue intact
T422	Claim 5344 5398	It is obvious that we should have a commitment to them
T423	Claim 5400 5449	that Social Security benefits should not be taxed
T424	Claim 5454 5572	that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which Social Security payments are made to retired people
T425	Claim 6092 6155	we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance
T426	Premise 6157 6202	with an emphasis on the prevention of disease
T427	Premise 6204 6256	an emphasis on out-patient care, not in-patient care
T428	Premise 6258 6359	an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill
T429	Premise 6361 6552	an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it
T430	Claim 6554 6650	These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people
T431	Premise 6741 6849	When I opposed Medicare, there was another piece of legislation meeting the same problem before the Congress
T432	Claim 7024 7083	I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them
T433	Premise 6851 7022	I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed
T434	Claim 7085 7139	I was opposing one piece of legislation versus another
T435	Claim 7310 7521	I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness
T436	Premise 7527 7669	they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care
T437	Claim 7747 7953	I think this debate on Social Security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party
T438	Premise 7955 8108	The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation
T439	Claim 8526 8586	when they get in office, they try to govern like Republicans
T440	Premise 8318 8423	I noticed recently that Governor Reagan frequently quotes Democratic presidents in his acceptance address
T441	Premise 8425 8520	I have never heard a candidate for President, who is a Republican, quote a Republican president
T442	Claim 8592 8792	it is good fo the American people to remember that there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues - also, between the two parties that we represent
T443	Premise 8110 8316	These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them
T548	Claim 2735 2783	which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it
T1	Claim 552 607	The Social Security system was based on a false premise
T2	Premise 609 720	with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase
