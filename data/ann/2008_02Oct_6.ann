T235	Claim 326 402	Alaska feels and sees impacts of climate change more so than any other state
T236	Premise 254 324	as the nation's only Arctic state and being the governor of that state
T237	Claim 408 430	we know that it's real
T238	Claim 516 632	There is something to be said also for man's activities, but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet
T239	Claim 634 684	But there are real changes going on in our climate
T240	Claim 825 860	We have got to clean up this planet
T241	Claim 862 962	We have got to encourage other nations also to come along with us with the impacts of climate change
T242	Premise 1004 1099	I was the first governor to form a climate change sub-cabinet to start dealing with the impacts
T243	Claim 1101 1130	We've got to reduce emissions
T244	Premise 1132 1230	John McCain is right there with an "all of the above" approach to deal with climate change impacts
T245	Claim 1232 1286	We've got to become energy independent for that reason
T246	Premise 1293 1487	as we rely more and more on other countries that don't care as much about the climate as we do, we're allowing them to produce and to emit and even pollute more than America would ever stand for
T247	Claim 1492 1717	even in dealing with climate change, it's all the more reason that we have an "all of the above" approach, tapping into alternative sources of energy and conserving fuel, conserving our petroleum products and our hydrocarbons
T248	Premise 1718 1782	so that we can clean up this planet and deal with climate change
T249	Claim 1865 1886	I think it is manmade
T250	Claim 1888 1916	I think it's clearly manmade
T251	Claim 1918 2085	And, look, this probably explains the biggest fundamental difference between John McCain and Barack Obama and Sarah Palin and Joe Biden -- Governor Palin and Joe Biden
T252	Premise 2086 2181	If you don't understand what the cause is, it's virtually impossible to come up with a solution
T253	Claim 2183 2208	We know what the cause is
T254	Claim 2210 2230	The cause is manmade
T255	Claim 2232 2248	That's the cause
T256	Claim 2250 2288	That's why the polar icecap is melting
T257	Premise 2414 2562	John McCain has voted 20 times in the last decade-and-a-half against funding alternative energy sources, clean energy sources, wind, solar, biofuels
T258	Premise 2564 2627	The way in which we can stop the greenhouse gases from emitting
T259	Premise 2320 2365	We have 3 percent of the world's oil reserves
T260	Premise 2367 2412	We consume 25 percent of the oil in the world
T261	Claim 2643 2708	Barack Obama believes by investing in clean coal and safe nuclear
T262	Claim 2710 2799	we can not only create jobs in wind and solar here in the United States, we can export it
T263	Premise 2801 2881	China is building one to three new coal-fired plants burning dirty coal per week
T264	Premise 2883 2961	It's polluting not only the atmosphere but the West Coast of the United States
T265	Claim 2963 3032	We should export the technology by investing in clean coal technology
T266	Claim 3034 3060	We should be creating jobs
T267	Premise 3062 3135	John McCain has voted 20 times against funding alternative energy sources
T268	Premise 3148 3195	I guess, the only answer is drill, drill, drill
T269	Claim 3197 3210	Drill we must
T270	Premise 3212 3327	but it will take 10 years for one drop of oil to come out of any of the wells that are going to begun to be drilled
T271	Claim 3329 3383	In the meantime, we're all going to be in real trouble
T272	Claim 3596 3622	I have always supported it
T273	Claim 3725 3762	Yes, Senator McCain does support this
T274	Claim 3624 3637	That's a fact
T275	Claim 3764 3796	The chant is "drill, baby, drill
T276	Claim 3803 3861	that's what we hear all across this country in our rallies
T277	Premise 3862 3945	because people are so hungry for those domestic sources of energy to be tapped into
T278	Premise 3947 4102	They know that even in my own energy-producing state we have billions of barrels of oil and hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of clean, green natural gas
T279	Premise 4104 4300	And we're building a nearly $40 billion natural gas pipeline which is North America's largest and most you expensive infrastructure project ever to flow those sources of energy into hungry markets
T280	Claim 4301 4434	Barack Obama and Senator Biden, you've said no to everything in trying to find a domestic solution to the energy crisis that we're in
T281	Premise 4436 4550	You even called drilling -- safe, environmentally-friendly drilling offshore as raping the outer continental shelf
T282	Claim 4552 4667	There -- with new technology, with tiny footprints even on land, it is safe to drill and we need to do more of that
T283	Claim 4669 4814	But also in that "all of the above" approach that Senator McCain supports, the alternative fuels will be tapped into: the nuclear, the clean coal
T284	Claim 4816 4856	I was surprised to hear you mention that
T285	Premise 4857 4933	because you had said that there isn't anything -- such a thing as clean coal
T286	Premise 4939 5002	I think you said it in a rope line, too, at one of your rallies
T289	Claim 5410 5468	My record for 25 years has supported clean coal technology
T290	Claim 5470 5524	A comment made in a rope line was taken out of context
T291	Claim 5526 5580	I was talking about exporting that technology to China
T292	Premise 5581 5655	so when they burn their dirty coal, it won't be as dirty, it will be clean
T293	Premise 5826 5866	the governor says John is for everything
T294	Claim 5902 5980	Maybe he's for everything as long as it's not helped forward by the government
T295	Claim 5982 6043	Maybe he's for everything if the free market takes care of it
T296	Premise 6059 6123	But he voted 20 times against funding alternative energy sources
