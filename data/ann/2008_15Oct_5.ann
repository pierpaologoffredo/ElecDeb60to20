T580	Claim 334 445	I would never and have never in all the years I've been there imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court
T581	Claim 447 475	That's not appropriate to do
T582	Claim 580 631	I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad
T583	Claim 633 694	I think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states
T584	Claim 547 578	I thought it was a bad decision
T585	Premise 696 712	I'm a federalist
T586	Claim 718 858	I believe strongly that we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test
T587	Claim 1657 1706	That's not the way we should judge these nominees
T588	Claim 1815 1949	I will find the best people in the world -- in the United States of America who have a history of strict adherence to the Constitution

T594	Premise 1530 1655	Senator Obama voted against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts on the grounds that they didn't meet his ideological standards
T595	Premise 1477 1527	This is a very important issue we're talking about
T596	Premise 1325 1475	Not because I agreed with their ideology, but because I thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated
T597	Premise 1276 1323	I voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg
T598	Premise 1181 1274	You chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, "conservative judges."
T599	Premise 1146 1179	You were offered a chance to join
T600	Premise 1094 1144	We got together seven Republicans, seven Democrats
T601	Premise 966 1092	Republicans wanted to have just a majority vote to confirm a judge and the Democrats were blocking in an unprecedented fashion
T602	Claim 2125 2172	I would consider anyone in their qualifications
T603	Claim 2174 2276	I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be part of those qualifications
T604	Claim 2282 2326	I certainly would not impose any litmus test
T605	Claim 2365 2542	I think it's true that we shouldn't apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people
T606	Claim 2548 2655	it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president
T607	Premise 2657 2807	It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance
T608	Claim 2814 2847	I would not provide a litmus test
T609	Claim 2853 2920	I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided
T610	Claim 2922 3056	I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on

T612	Claim 3233 3337	I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldn't be subject to state referendum
T613	Premise 3339 3411	any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum
T614	Premise 3413 3498	any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote
T615	Claim 3512 3550	this is going to be an important issue
T616	Claim 3552 3620	I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record
T617	Claim 3622 3644	who have the intellect
T618	Claim 3650 3719	who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through
T619	Premise 3721 3757	I'll just give you one quick example
T620	Premise 3759 3920	Senator McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination
T621	Premise 3923 4018	For years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job
T622	Premise 4024 4220	when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it's taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didn't know about it until fairly recently
T623	Premise 4223 4260	We tried to overturn it in the Senate
T624	Premise 4262 4351	I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.
T625	Claim 4353 4573	I think that it's important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will
T626	Claim 4579 4615	that's the kind of judge that I want
T627	Claim 4843 4883	We have to change the culture of America
T628	Premise 4885 4937	Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that
T629	Claim 5997 6126	It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America
T630	Claim 5854 5871	that's his record
T631	Claim 4943 5056	it's got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who's facing this terribly difficult decision
T632	Premise 5059 5246	Senator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion
T633	Premise 5248 5269	He voted against that
T634	Premise 5276 5372	then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present
T635	Premise 5375 5621	Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really -- one of the bad procedures, a terrible
T636	Premise 5627 5692	then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present
T637	Premise 5695 5746	I don't know how you vote "present" on some of that
T638	Premise 5748 5848	I don't know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America
T639	Claim 6294 6307	it's not true
T640	Premise 6188 6277	If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant
T641	Premise 6336 6503	There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade
T642	Premise 6522 6615	there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment
T643	Premise 6617 6703	which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it
T644	Premise 6710 6797	the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it
T645	Premise 6799 6904	Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books
T646	Claim 6907 7099	With respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there's an exception for the mother's health and life
T647	Premise 7105 7140	this did not contain that exception
T648	Premise 7147 7232	I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional
T649	Premise 7238 7255	that was rejected
T650	Premise 7272 7287	I voted present
T651	Claim 7297 7382	I'm willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception
T652	Claim 8097 8148	I think that's where we can find some common ground
T653	Premise 8158 8179	nobody's pro-abortion
T655	Premise 7441 7485	This is an issue that -- look, it divides us
T656	Premise 7491 7557	in some ways, it may be difficult to -- to reconcile the two views
T657	Premise 7564 8001	there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, "We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby."
T658	Premise 8003 8091	Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year
T659	Claim 8230 8273	We should try to reduce these circumstances
T654	Premise 8189 8219	it's always a tragic situation
T660	Premise 8393 8450	Just again, the example of the eloquence of Senator Obama
T661	Premise 8452 8478	He's health for the mother
T662	Claim 8490 8575	that's been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything
T663	Premise 8577 8635	That's the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, "health."
T664	Premise 8647 8679	Cindy and I are adoptive parents
T665	Premise 8681 8756	We know what a treasure and joy it is to have an adopted child in our lives
T666	Claim 8758 8820	We'll do everything we can to improve adoption in this country
T667	Premise 8827 8900	that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn
T668	Claim 8913 8937	we have to come together
T669	Claim 8950 8974	we have to work together
T670	Claim 8992 9084	it's vital that we do so and help these young women who are facing such a difficult decision
T671	Premise 9086 9237	with a compassion, that we'll help them with the adoptive services, with the courage to bring that child into this world and we'll help take care of it
T672	Claim 9856 9923	This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything
T673	Claim 9928 9982	that means it also has a national security implication
T674	Premise 9992 10115	there's never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power
T675	Claim 10120 10163	we've got to get our education system right
T676	Claim 10261 10281	I think we need both
T677	Claim 10283 10328	In some cases, we are going to have to invest
T678	Premise 10330 10577	Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates
T679	Claim 10580 10856	I think it's going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability
T680	Claim 10863 10919	I think it's important for us to make college affordable
T681	Premise 10932 11019	I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college
T682	Premise 11023 11119	if they're going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt
T683	Premise 11125 11312	it's very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they're going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house
T684	Claim 11539 11618	If we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system
T685	Claim 11330 11536	I've proposed a $4,000 tuition credit, every student, every year, in exchange for some form of community service, whether it's military service, whether it's Peace Corps, whether it's working in a community
T686	Premise 11625 11700	there's one last ingredient that I just want to mention, and that's parents
T687	Premise 11702 11736	We can't do it just in the schools
T688	Claim 11738 11791	Parents are going to have to show more responsibility
T689	Premise 11793 11934	They've got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need
T690	Claim 12275 12340	choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements
T691	Premise 12341 12528	that's already been proven in places in like New Orleans and New York City and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them
T692	Premise 12535 12576	we find bad teachers another line of work
T693	Claim 12582 12775	we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Senator Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school -- their kids to the school of their choice
T694	Premise 12777 12850	Charter schools aren't the only answer, but they're providing competition
T695	Premise 12852 12947	They are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools -- types of schools
T696	Claim 12955 13002	throwing money at the problem is not the answer
T697	Premise 13004 13097	You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student
T698	Claim 13103 13155	I believe that we need to reward these good teachers
T699	Premise 13167 13434	We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which -- or have the certification that some are required in some states

T702	Claim 13636 13698	We need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition
T703	Claim 13704 13773	we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation
T704	Claim 14016 14155	I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do
T705	Premise 13912 14010	we have a tradition of local control of the schools and that's a tradition that has served us well

T710	Premise 14397 14674	the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped
T711	Claim 14680 14800	what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support
T712	Claim 14994 15064	I think it's important to foster competition inside the public schools
T713	Premise 14802 14874	Senator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned
T714	Premise 14877 14992	Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions
T715	Claim 15071 15213	we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly -- after given an opportunity to prove themselves
T716	Claim 15215 15261	if they can't hack it, then we need to move on
T717	Premise 15270 15309	our kids have to have their best future
T718	Claim 15809 15858	I don't think America's youth are interest groups

T722	Premise 15312 15457	Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers -- give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system
T723	Claim 16069 16197	if we're going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it
T724	Premise 16199 16234	It's not going to happen on its own
T725	Claim 15956 16062	We can't say we're going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we're going to pay for it
T726	Premise 15892 15954	this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize
T727	Claim 17247 17290	spending more money isn't always the answer
T728	Claim 17194 17232	We need to sit down and reauthorize it
T729	Claim 17292 17341	I think the Head Start program is a great program

T732	Premise 16541 16624	they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and Cindy and your wife have had
