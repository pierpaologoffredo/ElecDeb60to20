T605	Premise 23291 23313	We didn't cut Medicare
T606	Premise 23315 23392	Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by $716 billion
T607	Premise 23404 23507	We didn't put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive
T608	Premise 23509 23707	We didn't also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put -- put people in a position where they're going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted
T609	Premise 23709 23822	Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year
T610	Premise 23828 23963	likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage
T611	Claim 24086 24145	American people don't want Medicare -- don't want Obamacare
T612	Premise 23969 24068	for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance
T613	Premise 24147 24229	It's why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had -- had the plan
T614	Premise 24231 24250	They put a plan out
T615	Claim 24313 24392	I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis
T616	Premise 24252 24290	They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan
T617	Premise 24292 24310	It was swept aside
T618	Claim 24398 24523	we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties
T619	Claim 24598 24624	This was a bipartisan idea
T620	Premise 24534 24596	Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis
T621	Claim 24635 24659	it was a Republican idea
T622	Premise 24665 24788	Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation
T623	Premise 24794 24929	I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate
T624	Premise 24935 25020	the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it's the same plan
T625	Premise 25029 25264	when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we've created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall?
T626	Claim 25283 25340	there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis
T627	Claim 25342 25431	One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves
T628	Claim 25433 25585	to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured
T629	Premise 25591 25617	that's been the trend line
T630	Claim 25624 25704	alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective
T631	Claim 25710 25736	there are ways of doing it
T632	Premise 25742 25866	at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average
T633	Premise 25872 25927	the reason they do is because they do some smart things
T634	Premise 25937 26083	they say, if a patient's coming in, let's get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests
T635	Premise 26085 26192	Let's make sure that we're providing preventive care so we're catching the onset of something like diabetes
T636	Premise 26203 26330	let's pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they've -- they've engaged in
T637	Claim 26341 26527	what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let's use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do
T638	Claim 26566 26668	when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down
T639	Premise 26674 26810	over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years
T640	Claim 26815 26854	we're already beginning to see progress
T641	Premise 26856 26936	In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you're already getting a rebate
T642	Claim 27105 27215	he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying we're going to leave it to the states
T643	Premise 26967 27083	Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I'm just going to repeal it, but -- but we can replace it with something
T644	Claim 27357 27490	there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance
T645	Premise 27230 27355	the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines
T646	Claim 27501 27604	it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance
T647	Premise 27638 27675	at a time when it's vitally important
T648	Claim 27918 27966	preexisting conditions are covered under my plan
T649	Claim 27980 28030	young people are able to stay on their family plan
T650	Premise 28032 28081	That's already offered in the private marketplace
T651	Premise 28083 28151	You don't have to have the government mandate that for that to occur
T652	Claim 28528 28625	In my opinion, the government is not effective in -- in bringing down the cost of almost anything
T653	Premise 28332 28503	he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have
T654	Premise 28157 28321	let's come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it's more affordable for families
T655	Premise 28627 28809	As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be
T656	Premise 28811 28911	Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe
T657	Premise 28914 28940	This is the private market
T658	Premise 28961 29051	these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs
T659	Premise 29053 29140	I used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers
T660	Premise 29142 29226	I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people
T661	Claim 29229 29370	In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have
T662	Claim 29372 29565	We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down
T663	Claim 29571 29587	that's happening
T664	Premise 29589 29635	Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well
T665	Premise 29637 29700	Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others
T666	Claim 29716 29913	the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have
T667	Claim 29915 29941	That's the wrong way to go
T668	Claim 29943 30008	The private market and individual responsibility always work best
T669	Claim 30054 30142	this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given
T670	Premise 30144 30183	That's explicitly prohibited in the law
T671	Claim 30346 30376	that isn't what your plan does
T672	Premise 30211 30319	Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions
T673	Claim 30378 30629	What your plan does is to duplicate what's already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if you've -- if it's been under 90 days
T674	Premise 30636 30658	that's already the law
T675	Claim 30663 30741	that doesn't help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions
T676	Premise 30743 30824	There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts
T677	Claim 30826 30872	It wasn't a government takeover of health care
T678	Claim 30874 30923	It was the largest expansion of private insurance
T679	Premise 30929 30995	what it does say is that "insurers, you've got to take everybody."
T680	Premise 31002 31048	that also means that you've got more customers
T681	Premise 31062 31174	when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something, but can't detail how it will be in fact replaced
T682	Premise 31190 31234	he set up the system he did in Massachusetts
T683	Claim 31247 31322	there isn't a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem
T684	Premise 31333 31440	It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan
T685	Premise 31442 31478	That's how it's going to be paid for
T686	Premise 31484 31509	we don't know the details
T687	Premise 31511 31614	He says that he's going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don't know exactly which ones
T688	Premise 31616 31632	He won't tell us
T689	Premise 31634 31781	He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry
T690	Claim 32064 32244	The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices
T691	Claim 32250 32363	the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country
T693	Claim 32998 33021	Those are my principles
T694	Claim 33023 33084	I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families
T695	Claim 33090 33207	I'm going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what -- what are the various ways we could bring down deductions
T696	Claim 32646 32737	What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago
T697	Premise 32487 32644	which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and -- and lay down a piece of legislation and say, "It's my way or the highway," I don't get a lot done
T698	Premise 32739 32828	When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster
T699	Premise 32913 32996	You've said the same thing, you're going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base
T700	Premise 32871 32911	He said he was going to broaden the base
T701	Premise 32830 32869	He said he was going to lower tax rates
T702	Claim 33557 33715	There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth
T703	Premise 33451 33555	One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way
T704	Premise 33419 33449	That's one way one could do it
T705	Premise 33367 33417	then that number disappears for high-income people
T706	Premise 33316 33361	Anybody can have deductions up to that amount
T707	Premise 33280 33314	Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000
T708	Premise 33223 33278	One way, for instance, would be to have a single number
T709	Claim 33877 33945	I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions
T710	Premise 33947 33981	That's part of my health care plan
T711	Claim 33987 34056	what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state
T712	Premise 34062 34086	I said that at that time
T713	Claim 34089 34324	The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy
