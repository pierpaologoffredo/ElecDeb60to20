T359	Claim 571 698	the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error
T360	Premise 700 744	He says he supports the President's position
T361	Premise 746 786	He says that he voted for the resolution
T362	Premise 821 973	he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands
T363	Premise 979 1228	he also voted then for an amendment - which was lost, fortunately - an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa
T364	Premise 1230 1288	He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made
T365	Premise 1290 1345	He repeated it again in a television debate that we had
T366	Claim 1370 1415	Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here
T367	Premise 1417 1744	Either he's for the President and he's against the position that those who opposed the President in fifty-five and fifty-nine - and the Senator's position itself, stated the other day in our debate - either he is for the President and against that position or we simply have a disagreement here that must continue to be debated
T368	Claim 1750 2138	if the Senator in his answer to this question will say "I now will depart, or retract my previous views; I think I was wrong in I 955; I think I was wrong in 1959; and I think I was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out Quemoy and Matsu - draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the Communists;" then this will be right out of the campaign
T369	Premise 2147 2180	there will be no issue between us
T370	Premise 2182 2216	I support the President's position
T371	Claim 2218 2254	I have always opposed drawing a line
T372	Claim 2256 2285	I have opposed drawing a line
T373	Premise 2294 2467	I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack - to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want
T374	Premise 2476 2547	I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up
T375	Claim 2549 2650	It isn't enough for him to say "I support the President's position, that I voted for the resolution."
T376	Premise 2651 2718	Of course, he voted for the resolution - it was virtually unanimous
T377	Premise 2738 2882	what about his error in voting for the amendment, which was not adopted, and then persisting in it in fifty-nine, persisting in it in the debate
T378	Premise 2884 2923	It's very simple for him to clear it up
T379	Premise 2925 3048	He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense
T380	Claim 3050 3115	If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign
T381	Claim 4541 4555	I support that
T382	Premise 3202 3370	The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh - Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands
T383	Premise 3372 3569	Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed
T384	Premise 3571 3601	The President was unsuccessful
T385	Premise 3603 3637	Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw
T386	Premise 3639 3855	I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I'm very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands
T387	Premise 3857 3941	General Twining, in January, fifty-nine, described the position of the United States
T388	Claim 3943 4053	The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish
T389	Premise 4055 4105	Mr. Herter has said these islands are indefensible
T390	Premise 4107 4140	Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw
T391	Premise 4150 4170	he will not withdraw
T392	Premise 4180 4211	he's committed to these islands
T393	Premise 4221 4266	we've been unable to persuade him to withdraw
T394	Claim 4268 4303	we are in a very difficult position
T395	Premise 4320 4539	the President's judgment has been that we should defend the islands if, in his military judgment and the judgment of the commander in the field, the attack on these islands should be part of an overall attack on Formosa
T396	Claim 4557 4722	In view of the difficulties we've had with the islands, in view of the difficulties and disputes we've had with Chiang Kai-shek, that's the only position we can take
T397	Claim 4724 4756	That's not the position you took
T398	Premise 4767 4932	The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands
T399	Premise 4934 4990	Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores
T400	Premise 4992 5135	You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands
