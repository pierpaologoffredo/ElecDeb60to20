T357	Premise 5409 5494	regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality our water and our land

T381	Claim 8736 8999	If it is a well-known fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California - not a law, but regulations
T382	Claim 9183 9232	It would have destroyed the economy of California
