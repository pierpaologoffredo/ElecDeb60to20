T223	Claim 39439 39649	I object to that part of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill which I think is very unfair and would prove to be so. That is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of an employee before they're hired

T247	Claim 42613 42625	I'm doing it
T248	Premise 42801 42928	This bill imposes upon employers the responsibility of determining whether somebody who applies for a job is an American or not
T249	Premise 42930 43032	And just inevitably, they're going to be reluctant to hire Hispanics or people with a different accent
T250	Premise 43034 43116	If I were dealing with politics here, the polls show the American people want this
T251	Claim 43118 43146	I am for reform in this area
T252	Premise 43292 43341	despite the politics of it, I stand where I stand
T253	Claim 43347 43364	I think I'm right
T254	Claim 43370 43512	before this fight is over we're going to come up with a better bill, a more effective bill that does not undermine the liberties of our people
T255	Claim 43563 43593	our borders are out of control
T256	Premise 43599 43833	this fall you allowed the Simpson-Mazzoli bill -- which would at least have minimally protected our borders and the rights of citizenship -- because of a relatively unimportant issue of reimbursement to the States for legalized aliens
T257	Claim 44065 44168	we, believe me, supported the Simpson-Mazzoli bill strongly -- and the bill that came out of the Senate
T258	Premise 44179 44264	there were things added in in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill
T259	Premise 44287 44305	made it a bad bill
T260	Premise 44307 44494	And in conference -- we stayed with them in conference all the way to where even Senator Simpson did not want the bill in the manner in which it would come out of the conference committee
T261	Claim 44496 44558	There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill
T262	Claim 44615 44645	our borders are out of control
T263	Premise 44647 44749	It is also true that this has been a situation on our borders back through a number of administrations
T264	Claim 45527 45604	We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free
T265	Premise 44778 44926	I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally
T266	Premise 44928 45043	With regard to the employer sanctions, we must have that not only to ensure that we can identify the illegal aliens
T267	Premise 45119 45525	there is another employer that we shouldn't be so concerned about, and these are employers down through the years who have encouraged the illegal entry into this country because they then hire these individuals and hire them at starvation wages and with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country, and the individuals can't complain because of their illegal status
T268	Claim 45700 45900	I'm going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders
T270	Premise 46094 46244	as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment, they are going to seek that employment across our borders
T271	Premise 46250 46284	we work with those other countries
T272	Claim 46336 46453	the situation today is terribly different quantitatively -- qualitatively different from what it has been in the past
T274	Claim 46981 46983	No
T275	Claim 47006 47114	the population explosion, if you look at the actual figures, has been vastly exaggerated -- over exaggerated
T276	Premise 47137 47273	there are some pretty scientific and solid figures about how much space there still is in the world and how many more people we can have
T277	Premise 47275 47429	It's almost like going back to the Malthusian theory, when even then they were saying that everyone would starve with the limited population they had then
T278	Claim 47435 47512	the problem of population growth is one, here, with regard to our immigration
T279	Premise 47518 47727	we have been the safety valve, whether we wanted to or not, with the illegal entry here, in Mexico, where their population is increasing and they don't have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs
T280	Claim 47733 47873	this is what we're trying to work out, not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem
T281	Claim 47922 48124	One of the biggest problems today is that the countries to our south are so desperately poor that these people who will almost lose their lives if they don't come north, come north despite all the risks
T282	Premise 48194 48395	it goes to American economic and trade policies that permit these nations to have a chance to get on their own two feet and to get prosperity, so that they can have jobs for themselves and their people
T283	Claim 48412 48530	this enormous national debt, engineered by this administration, is harming these countries in fueling this immigration
T284	Premise 48532 48663	These high interest rates -- real rates that have doubled under this administration -- have had the same effect on Mexico and so on
T285	Claim 48787 48842	that drives our friends to the south up into our region
T286	Claim 49084 49112	it has nothing to do with it
T287	Claim 49309 49361	I predict it'll be coming down a little more shortly
T288	Premise 49118 49303	with regard to these high interest rates, too, at least give us the recognition of the fact that when you left office, Mr. Mondale, they were 21\1/2\ -- the prime rate. It's now 12\1/4\
T289	Claim 49367 49435	we're trying to undo some of the things that your administration did
T290	Claim 49637 49720	you do believe, deep down, that we are heading for some kind of biblical Armageddon
T291	Premise 49722 49836	Your Pentagon and your Secretary of Defense have plans for the United States to fight and prevail in a nuclear war
T292	Premise 50024 50222	I think what has been hailed as something I'm supposedly, as President, discussing as principle is the recall of just some philosophical discussions with people who are interested in the same things
T293	Premise 50228 50359	that is the prophecies down through the years, the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of Armageddon, and so forth
T294	Premise 50365 50522	the fact that a number of theologians for the last decade or more have believed that this was true, that the prophecies are coming together that portend that
T295	Premise 50528 50645	no one knows whether Armageddon, those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow
T296	Claim 50651 50726	I have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to Armageddon
T297	Claim 50825 50843	of course we would
T298	Claim 51010 51062	A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought
T299	Premise 51068 51247	that is why we are maintaining a deterrent and trying to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage
T300	Premise 51254 51377	the deterrent -- and that's what it is for -- is also what led me to propose what is now being called the Star Wars concept
T302	Premise 52333 52442	There has never been a weapon invented in the history of man that has not led to a defensive, a counterweapon
T304	Premise 52651 52917	why not do what I have offered to do and asked the Soviet Union to do? Say, "Look, here's what we can do. We'll even give it to you. Now, will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid, all of us, of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat?''
T305	Claim 52918 52978	I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon
T306	Premise 53261 53416	let me sharply disagree with the President on sharing the most advanced, the most dangerous, the most important technology in America with the Soviet Union
T308	Premise 53418 53537	We have had for many years, understandably, a system of restraints on high technology because the Soviets are behind us
T309	Premise 53543 53682	any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering
T310	Claim 53787 53848	I would not let the Soviet Union get their hands on it at all
T311	Claim 53884 53927	There's nothing wrong with the theory of it
T312	Premise 53929 54070	If we could develop a principle that would say both sides could fire all their missiles and no one would get hurt, I suppose it's a good idea
T313	Premise 54076 54361	the fact of it is we're so far away from research that even comes close to that, that the Director of Engineering Research at the Defense Department said to get there we would have to solve eight problems, each of which are more difficult than the atomic bomb and the Manhattan project
T314	Claim 54363 54437	It would cost something like a trillion dollars to test and deploy weapons
T315	Premise 54440 54518	The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldn't respond in kind
T316	Claim 54524 54538	they always do
T317	Premise 54540 54559	We don't get behind
T318	Premise 54561 54582	They won't get behind
T319	Claim 54635 54689	We have more at stake in space satellites than they do
T321	Premise 54951 55116	to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race that's very dangerous indeed
T322	Claim 55136 55275	The most dangerous aspect of this proposal is, for the first time, we would delegate to computers the decision as to whether to start a war
T323	Claim 55277 55294	That's dead wrong
T324	Premise 55296 55344	There wouldn't be time for a President to decide
T325	Premise 55346 55391	it would be decided by these remote computers
T326	Premise 55393 55502	It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it's a missile -- and off we go
T327	Premise 55793 55910	the basis of your arms proposals, as I understand them, is a mutual and verifiable freeze on existing weapons systems
T328	Claim 56040 56135	Every system that is verifiable should be placed on the table for negotiations for an agreement
T329	Premise 56137 56279	I would not agree to any negotiations or any agreement that involved conduct on the part of the Soviet Union that we couldn't verify every day
T330	Premise 56281 56399	I would not agree to any agreement in which the United States security interest was not fully recognized and supported
T331	Claim 56492 56557	this ever-rising arms race madness makes both nations less secure
T332	Claim 56559 56600	It's more difficult to defend this nation
T333	Claim 56602 56644	It's putting a hair-trigger on nuclear war
T334	Premise 56646 56745	This administration, by going into the Star Wars system, is going to add a dangerous new escalation
T335	Claim 56792 56819;56882 56932	I think the American people and the people of the Soviet Union want it to stop
T336	Premise 57023 57598	this invention that has just been created here of how I would go about rolling over for the Soviet Union -- no, Mr. Mondale, my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with them and then say, "Now, are you willing to join us? Here's what we'' -- give them a demonstration and then say -- "Here's what we can do. Now, if you're willing to join us in getting rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world, then we'll give you this one, so that we would both know that no one can cheat; that we're both got something that if anyone tries to cheat . . . .''
T337	Claim 57636 57694	I never suggested where the weapons should be or what kind
T338	Premise 57696 57715	I'm not a scientist
T339	Premise 57717 57884	I said, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed with me, that it was time for us to turn our research ability to seeing if we could not find this kind of defensive weapon
T340	Premise 57886 57978	And suddenly somebody says, "Oh, it's got to be up there, and it's Star Wars,'' and so forth
T341	Claim 57980 58079	I don't know what it would be, but if we can come up with one, I think the world will be better off
T342	Claim 58135 58216	that's what a President's supposed to know -- where those weapons are going to be
T343	Claim 58379 58432	this is the most dangerous technology that we possess
T344	Premise 58434 58480	The Soviets try to spy on us, steal this stuff
T345	Premise 58482 58539	And to give them technology of this kind, I disagree with
T346	Claim 58541 58590	You haven't just accepted research, Mr. President
T347	Claim 58772 58798	This is an arms escalation
T348	Claim 58804 58863	we will be better off, far better off, if we stop right now
T349	Premise 58873 58915	we have more to lose in space then they do
T350	Premise 58917 58987	If someday, somebody comes along with an answer, that's something else
T351	Premise 58993 59054	that there would be an answer in our lifetime is unimaginable
T352	Claim 59145 59174	That's what a President's for
T355	Claim 59715 59824	we have a vast range of technology and weaponry right now that provides all the bargaining chips that we need
T356	Premise 59830 60043	I support the air launch cruise missile, the ground launch cruise missile, the Pershing missile, the Trident submarine, the D - 5 submarine, Stealth technology, the Midgetman -- we have a whole range of technology
T357	Claim 60080 60099	it's a sitting duck
T358	Claim 60101 60121	It'll draw an attack
T359	Claim 60123 60190	It puts a hair-trigger, and it is a dangerous, destabilizing weapon
T360	Claim 60196 60232	the B - 1 is similarly to be opposed

T366	Claim 60937 61027	we can use this money that we save on these weapons to spend on things that we really need
T367	Premise 61029 61082	Our conventional strength in Europe is under strength
T370	Premise 61399 61452	Every President until this one has been able to do it
T371	Claim 61458 61515	this nation -- or the world is more dangerous as a result
T372	Claim 61645 61700	you do have some problems with the extent of the freeze
T374	Claim 61822 61860	Research would be impossible to verify
T375	Claim 61862 61959	Numbers of warheads would be impossible to verify by satellite, except for with onsite inspection
T373	Claim 61736 61777	testing would be very difficult to verify
T376	Premise 61786 61820	the Soviets encode their telemetry
T377	Claim 62081 62170	I will not agree to any arms control agreement, including a freeze, that's not verifiable
T378	Premise 62207 62272	The warhead principle -- there have been counting rules for years
T379	Premise 62274 62460	Whenever a weapon is tested we count the number of warheads on it, and whenever that warhead is used we count that number of warheads, whether they have that number or less on it, or not
T380	Claim 62488 62607	I will not agree to any production restrictions -- or agreements, unless we have the ability to verify those agreements
T381	Claim 62609 62635	I don't trust the Russians

T388	Premise 63756 63845	The Shah had done our bidding and carried our load in the Middle East for quite some time
T389	Premise 63945 64142	The Shah, whatever he might have done, was building low-cost housing, had taken land away from the Mullahs and was distributing it to the peasants so they could be landowners -- things of that kind

T391	Claim 64294 64317	I never defended Somoza
T393	Premise 64345 64502	the previous administration stood by and so did I -- not that I could have done anything in my position at that time -- but for this revolution to take place

T401	Premise 65175 65234	They have been our friend since their inception as a nation
T402	Claim 65241 65497	I think that we've had enough of a record of letting -- under the guise of revolution -- someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative
T403	Claim 65503 65730	I think that we're better off, for example with the Philippines, of trying to retain our friendship and help them right the wrongs we see, rather than throwing them to the wolves and then facing a Communist power in the Pacific
T404	Premise 65995 66099	we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow
T405	Premise 66105 66205	there is every evidence, every indication that that government would be hostile to the United States

T421	Claim 68025 68207	Human rights are not advanced when, at the same time, you then stand back and say, "Whoops, we didn't know the gun was loaded,'' and you have another totalitarian power on your hands
T422	Claim 68810 68898	you might be trying to gain the sort of advantage that would enable you to dictate terms

T423	Premise 9346 9379	a President's supposed to command
T50	Claim 10225 10273	that particular thing, which is absolutely false
T424	Premise 10275 10426	How anyone could think that any sane person would believe you could call back a nuclear missile, I think is as ridiculous as the whole concept has been
T52	Claim 11173 11270	I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have
T425	Premise 16658 16695	He's 3 years into this administration
T426	Premise 16697 16802	He said he just discovered that most Soviet missiles are on land, and that's why his proposal didn't work

T430	Claim 22682 22712	you might quarantine Nicaragua
T433	Claim 31616 31699	you were unaware that the Soviet retaliatory power was based on land-based missiles
T434	Premise 31960 32106	the whole controversy about land missiles came up because we thought that the strategic nuclear weapons, the most destabilizing are the land-based
T435	Premise 32108 32177	You put your thumb on a button and somebody blows up 20 minutes later
T436	Premise 32183 32248	we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate first with those
T437	Premise 32254 32348	then we made it plain, a second phase, take up the submarine-launched or the airborne missiles
T438	Premise 32350 32572	The Soviet Union, to our surprise -- and not just mine -- made it plain when we brought this up that they placed, they thought, a greater reliance on the land-based missiles and, therefore, they wanted to take up all three
T200	Claim 40946 41089	we need a measure -- and I will support a measure -- that brings about those objectives but avoids that one aspect that I think is very serious
T237	Premise 41225 41526	that's why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a good-faith way with Mexico, with Costa Rica, with the other nations in trying to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in Central America has undermined our capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well
T240	Premise 46511 46608	Mexico's population will go from about 60 million today to 120 million at the turn of the century
T439	Premise 46610 46708	Many of these people will be coming into the United States not as citizens, but as illegal workers

T442	Premise 69368 69471	it seems to me that this could be an adjunct, or certainly a great assisting agent in getting that done
T443	Claim 69473 69596	I am not going to roll over, as Mr. Mondale suggests, and give them something that could turn around and be used against us
T444	Claim 69602 69754	I think it's a very interesting proposal, to see if we can find, first of all, something that renders those weapons obsolete, incapable of their mission
T445	Premise 69760 69792	Mr. Mondale seems to approve MAD
T446	Claim 69993 70140	I think that to do everything we can to find, as I say, something that would destroy weapons and not humans is a great step forward in human rights
T447	Claim 70451 70548	I believe in a sensible arms control approach that brings down these weapons to manageable levels
T448	Claim 70610 70691	we have to be strong enough to make certain that the Soviet Union never tempts us
T449	Premise 70698 70763	here we have to decide between generalized objectives and reality
