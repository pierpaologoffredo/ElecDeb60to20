T223	Claim 616 642	I think it's a moral issue

T225	Premise 744 892	knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they're going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives
T226	Claim 898 972	the amount of debt we're adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral
T227	Claim 1008 1071	mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit

T235	Claim 1286 1346	The presidents would -- president would prefer raising taxes
T236	Premise 1362 1433	The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth
T237	Claim 1439 1477	you could never quite get the job done
T238	Claim 1479 1550	I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time
T239	Claim 1612 1758	I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?
T240	Claim 1763 1789	if not, I'll get rid of it

T252	Claim 3053 3252	we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis

T261	Premise 4251 4268	It's on a website
T262	Premise 4270 4346	You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise
T263	Premise 4353 4580	the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit
T264	Premise 4582 4645	Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission
T265	Premise 4653 4835	that's how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts
T266	Premise 4988 5155	when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue?
T267	Premise 5160 5170	he said no
T268	Claim 5178 5303	if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education
T269	Premise -1 94; -1 94	It means that Governor Romney talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states
T270	Claim 5435 5578	effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities

T278	Premise 6366 6398	You've been president four years

T287	Claim 6904 6933	That doesn't get the job done
T288	Premise 7088 7314	You said, "Look, I'm going to extend the tax policies that we have now; I'm not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we're in recession, you shouldn't raise taxes on anyone."

T290	Premise 7378 7445	it's growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement
T291	Claim 7485 7529	you just don't want to raise taxes on people

T304	Premise 8314 8351	Governor Romney has ruled out revenue
T305	Premise 8353 8375	He's ruled out revenue
T306	Claim 8399 8409	Absolutely
T307	Premise 8438 8520	the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes
T308	Claim 8522 8576	That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget
T309	Claim 8582 8669	the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, you'll never get there
T310	Claim 8671 8719	You'll never balance the budget by raising taxes
T311	Premise 8730 8790	Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government
T312	Premise 8792 8850	We're now spending 42 percent of our economy on government

T316	Claim 9257 9307	this is not just when it comes to individual taxes

T319	Premise 9521 9626	Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don't get
T320	Premise 9634 9749	does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they're making money every time you go to the pump?
T321	Premise 9750 9789	Why wouldn't we want to eliminate that?
T322	Premise 9790 9846	Why wouldn't we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets?
T323	Claim 9863 9966	if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it
T324	Claim 10197 10224	I want to do the same thing
T325	Claim 10230 10273	I've actually identified how we can do that
T326	Premise 9969 10188	When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions -- he hasn't identified which ones they are -- but that thereby bring down the corporate rate
T327	Claim 10279 10374	part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas
T328	Premise 10377 10449	Right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas
T329	Claim 10451 10507	I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense
T330	Premise 10513 10536	all that raises revenue

T333	Premise 10546 10576	if we take a balanced approach

T336	Premise 10982 11028	They're using text books that are 10 years old

T341	Claim 11243 11289	we've got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff
T342	Premise 11190 11220	if we're asking for no revenue
T343	Claim 11296 11461	the magnitude of the tax cuts that you're talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow
T344	Premise 11464 11614	As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking about potentially a 30 -- a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time
T345	Premise 11632 11720	that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper
T346	Claim 11819 11839	that's a big problem
T347	Premise 11726 11817	if we're talking about a family who's got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid
T348	Premise 11846 11868	governors are creative
T349	Premise 11870 11895	There's no doubt about it
T350	Claim 11901 11992	they're not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid
T351	Claim 11994 12055	What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help
T352	Claim 12547 12566	It's time to end it
T353	Claim 13386 13433	this is not the kind of policy you want to have
T354	Premise 13434 13474	if you want to get America energy secure
T355	Claim 13723 13802	the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case
T356	Premise 12343 12431	the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year
T357	Premise 12437 12529	it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's been in place for a hundred years
T358	Claim 12792 12877	this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth
T359	Premise 12581 12654	in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world
T360	Premise 12661 12751	I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives
T361	Premise 12904 13001	if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table
T362	Premise 13003 13030	Of course it's on the table
T363	Premise 13032 13105	That's probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent
T364	Premise 13111 13250	don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1
T365	Premise 13477 13560	The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas
T366	Premise 13568 13602	I've been in business for 25 years
T367	Premise 13604 13644	I have no idea what you're talking about
T368	Claim 13871 13929	I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country
T369	Claim 14027 14264	I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best
T370	Premise 14271 14416	I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that
T371	Premise 14418 14557	We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor
T372	Premise 14584 14696	one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy
T373	Claim 14698 14839	Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have
T374	Claim 14841 14859	Let states do this
T375	Premise 14879 14969	if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them
T376	Claim 15024 15133	the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government
