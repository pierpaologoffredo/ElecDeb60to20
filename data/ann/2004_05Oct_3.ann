T2	Question 136 555	Today, a senior member of Islamic Jihad was killed in Gaza. There have been suicide bombings, targeted assassinations, mortar attacks, all of this continuing at a time when the United States seems absent in the peace-making process.  What would your administration do?  First of all, do you agree that the United States is absent? Maybe you don't.  But what would your administration do to try to resolve that conflict?
T3	Premise 1030 1552	I was in Jerusalem a couple of years ago, actually three years ago, in August of 2001, staying at the King David Hotel.  We left in the morning, headed to the airport to leave, and later in the day I found out that that same day, not far from where we were staying, the Sbarro Pizzeria was hit by a suicide bomber in Jerusalem. Fifteen people were killed. Six children were killed.  What are the Israeli people supposed to do? How can they continue to watch Israeli children killed by suicide bombers, killed by terrorists
